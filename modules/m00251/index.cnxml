<para id="para-00001">For the most part, cyclic ethers behave like acyclic ethers. The chemistry of the ether functional group is the same, whether it’s in an open chain or in a ring. Common cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane are often used as solvents because of their inertness, yet they can be cleaved by strong acids.</para>
<figure class="unnumbered scaled-down-30" id="fig-00001">
<media alt="An illustration shows the structure of “1 4-Dioxane” and “Tetrahydrofuran.” The structure of 1 4-Dioxane shows a cyclohexane with oxygen atoms (shown in pink) at the first and fourth positions and a methylene group in the remaining four positions. The structure of Tetrahydrofuran shows a cyclopentane with an oxygen atom (shown in pink) at the tip and a methylene group in the remaining four positions.">

<para id="para-00002">The one group of cyclic ethers that behaves differently from open-chain ethers are the three-membered-ring compounds called <emphasis effect="italics">epoxides,</emphasis> or <emphasis effect="italics">oxiranes,</emphasis> which we saw in <link document="m00095"/>. The strain of the three-membered ring gives epoxides unique chemical reactivity.</para>
<para id="para-00003">Ethylene oxide, the simplest epoxide, is an intermediate in the manufacture of both ethylene glycol, used for automobile antifreeze, and polyester polymers. Approximately 37 million tons of ethylene oxide is produced worldwide each year, most of it by air oxidation of ethylene over a silver oxide catalyst at 300 °C. This process is not useful for other epoxides, however, and is of little value in the laboratory.</para>
<para id="para-00004">Note that the name <emphasis effect="italics">ethylene oxide</emphasis> is not a systematic one because the -<emphasis effect="italics">ene</emphasis> ending implies the presence of a double bond in the molecule. The name is frequently used, however, because ethylene oxide is derived <emphasis effect="italics">from</emphasis> ethylene by addition of an oxygen atom. Other simple epoxides are named similarly. The systematic name for ethylene oxide is 1,2-epoxyethane.</para>

<media alt="An illustration shows a chemical reaction and an electrostatic potential map. The chemical reaction shows the conversion of “Ethylene” to “Ethylene oxide” in the presence of oxygen (shown in pink) and silver oxide at 300 degrees C. The structure of ethylene shows two methylene groups double bonded to each other. The structure of Ethylene oxide shows 2 methylene groups bonded to each other and bonded to a common oxygen atom (shown in pink). The electrostatic potential map of ethylene oxide shows a ball-and-stick model having 2 gray balls representing carbon atoms 4 white balls representing hydrogen atoms and 1 red ball representing oxygen atom. The region around the oxygen is shown in red while the region around the methylene groups is shown in bluish green.">

<para id="para-00005">In the laboratory, as we saw in <link document="m00095"/>, epoxides are usually prepared by treatment of an alkene with a peroxyacid (RCO<sub>3</sub>H), typically <emphasis effect="italics">m</emphasis>-chloroperoxybenzoic acid.</para>
<figure class="unnumbered scaled-down" id="fig-00003">
<media alt="An illustration shows a chemical reaction of a “cycloheptene” combined with “meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid” in the presence of a solvent dichloromethane to yield “1 2-Epoxycycloheptane” and “meta-Chlorobenzoic acid.” The structure of meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid shows a benzene with C4 bonded to a chlorine atom; C1 is bonded to a carboxyl group bonded to a pink oxygen that is bonded to a hydrogen. The structure of 1 2-Epoxycycloheptane shows a cycloheptene with C1 and C2 wedge bonded to a common oxygen atom (shown in pink). C1 and C2 are dash bonded to a hydrogen atom each. The structure of meta-Chlorobenzoic acid shows a benzene with C4 bonded to a chlorine atom; C1 is bonded to a carboxyl group.">

<para id="para-00006">Epoxides can also be prepared from halohydrins, themselves produced by electrophilic addition of Cl<sub>2</sub> or Br2 to an alkene in the presence of water (<link document="m00091"/>). When a halohydrin is treated with base, HX is eliminated and an epoxide is produced by an intramolecular Williamson ether synthesis. That is, the nucleophilic alkoxide ion and the electrophilic alkyl halide are in the same molecule.</para>
<figure class="unnumbered scaled-down" id="fig-00004">
<media alt="An illustration shows a chemical reaction where a “cyclohexene” in the presence of chlorine and water yields “trans-2-Chlorocyclohexanol.” This in the presence of blue sodium hydroxide and water yields an intermediate compound that further yields “1 2-Epoxycyclohexane.” The structure of cyclohexene shows a cyclohexane with two double bonds bonded to two hydrogen atoms. The structure of trans-2-Chlorocyclohexanol shows a cyclohexane wedge bonded to a hydroxyl group and dash bonded to a hydrogen atom at C1 and wedge bonded to a hydrogen atom and dash bonded to a green chlorine atom at C2. The structure of the intermediate compound shows a cyclohexane dash bonded to a hydrogen atom and wedge bonded to an oxygen anion with 3 pairs of electrons at C1; C2 is wedge bonded to a hydrogen atom and dash bonded to a chlorine atom. An arrow from the electrons of oxygen anion points to C2. An arrow from the C2-Cl bond points to Cl. The structure of 1 2-Epoxycyclohexane shows a cyclohexane with C1 and C2 wedge bonded to a common pink oxygen atom. C1 and C2 are dash bonded to a hydrogen atom each.">
