    <para id="para-00001">The bonds we’ve seen in methane and ethane are called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001"><emphasis effect="italics">bonds</emphasis></term> because they result from the sharing of one electron pair between bonded atoms.

      How are multiple bonds described by valence bond theory? When we discussed <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals in <link document="m00008"><emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup> Hybrid Orbitals and the Structure of Methane</link>, we said that the four valence-shell atomic orbitals of carbon combine to form four equivalent <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup> hybrids. Imagine instead that the 2<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> orbital combines with only <emphasis effect="italics">two</emphasis> of the three available 2<emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbitals. Three <term id="term-00005"><emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals</term> result, and one 2<emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbital remains unchanged. Like <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup> hybrids, <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals are unsymmetrical about the nucleus and are strongly oriented in a specific direction so they can form strong bonds. The three <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>2</sup> orbitals lie in a plane at angles of 120° to one another, with the remaining <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbital perpendicular to the <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>2</sup> plane, as shown in <link target-id="OChem_01_08_001.jpg"/>.

      When two carbons with <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>2</sup> hybridization approach each other, they form a strong σ bond by <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>2</sup>–<emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>2</sup> head-on overlap. At the same time, the unhybridized <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbitals interact by sideways overlap to form what is called a <term id="term-00007">pi (<m:math><m:mo>π</m:mo></m:math>) bond</term>. The combination of an <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>2</sup>–<emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>2</sup> σ bond and a 2<emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis>–2<emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> <m:math><m:mo>π</m:mo></m:math> bond results in the sharing of four electrons and the formation of a carbon–carbon <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">double bond</term> (<link target-id="OChem_01_08_002.jpg"/>). Note that the electrons in the σ bond occupy the region centered between nuclei, while the electrons in the <m:math><m:mo>π</m:mo></m:math> bond occupy regions above and below a line drawn between nuclei.
To complete the structure of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">ethylene</term>, four hydrogen atoms form σ bonds with the remaining four <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>2</sup> orbitals. Ethylene thus has a planar structure, with H–C–H and H–C–C bond angles of approximately 120°. (The actual values are 117.4° for the H–C–H bond angle and 121.3° for the H–C–C bond angle.) Each C–H bond has a length of 108.7 pm and a strength of 464 kJ/mol (111 kcal/mol).

  <media alt="Six illustrations are shown here. The first illustration shows three clover leaf- shaped structure in green one in blue and the other in pink attached at their tips. Small black dots are shown in all the lobes except the blue one. Small lines are shown projecting out from all the lobes. The second illustration is a mirror image of the first one. The pink lobes are commonly labeled “p orbitals” and the green lobes are labeled “s p superscript 2 orbitals.” Both illustrations are titled “s p superscript 2 carbon.” The third illustration shows the overlapping between the first two illustrations where two green lobes  two pink lobes and two blue lobes have overlapped with each other. The combined structure shows the label “C” at two different spots which were originally the centre of the structures shown in the first two illustrations. The point of overlapping of the pair of pink lobes and the green lobes have a pair of black dots each and the one in blue shows one black dot. Dots on the pink and blue lobes are labeled “pi bond” while the ones on the overlapped green lobes are labeled “sigma bond.” The fourth illustration shows two big black balls fused together and two small grey balls attached to each of these big black balls. The fifth illustration shows a molecular structure where two carbon atoms are connected through double bond. Each of the carbon atom is connected to two hydrogen atom sharing a single bond. The length between the carbon atoms is shown as “134 pm”; the angle between the single bond between carbon and hydrogen atom and the double bond between two carbon atoms is shown as “121.3 degrees;” the distance between a carbon and hydrogen atom is shown as “108.7 pm;” the angle formed between the single bond of the two hydrogen atoms attached to a carbon atom is shown as “117.4 degrees.” The sixth illustration shows a ball and stick model with two grey balls connected to each other through 2 sticks. Each of these grey balls is connected to two ivory balls through a single stick.">

<para id="para-00004">
  As you might expect, the carbon–carbon <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">double bond</term> in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">ethylene</term> is both shorter and stronger than the single bond in ethane because it has four electrons bonding the nuclei together rather than two. Ethylene has a C=C bond length of 134 pm and a strength of 728 kJ/mol (174 kcal/mol) versus a C–C length of 153 pm and a strength of 377 kJ/mol for ethane. The carbon–carbon double bond is less than twice as strong as a single bond because the sideways overlap in the <m:math><m:mo>π</m:mo></m:math> part of the double bond is not as great as the head-on overlap in the σ part.

    There is only one way that two hydrogens, one carbon, and one oxygen can combine:
  <figure id="OChem_01_08_003.jpg">
    <media alt="Two illustrations are shown here. The first illustrations titled “Electron-dot structure” shows a carbon atom with three pairs of black dots around it. Two of these pairs show a hydrogen atom next to it. An oxygen atom which is also surrounded by three pairs of black dots is shown above the carbon atom. One of these pairs is shown adjacent to the third pair of black dots surrounding the carbon atom. The second illustration titled “Line-dot structure” shows a carbon atom at the centre sharing a single bond with two hydrogen atoms and a double bond with an oxygen atom. Two pairs of black dots are shown on the sides of the oxygen atom.">

  Like the carbon atoms in ethylene, the carbon atom in formaldehyde is in a double bond and its orbitals are therefore <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>2</sup>-hybridized.
