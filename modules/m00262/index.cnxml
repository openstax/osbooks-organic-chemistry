<para id="para-00001">Enolate ions are more useful than enols for two reasons. First, pure enols can’t normally be isolated but are instead generated only as short-lived intermediates in low concentration. By contrast, stable solutions of pure enolate ions are easily prepared from most carbonyl compounds by reaction with a strong base. Second, enolate ions are more reactive than enols and undergo many reactions that enols don’t. Whereas enols are neutral, enolate ions are negatively charged, making them much better nucleophiles.</para>
<para id="para-00002">Because they are resonance hybrids of two nonequivalent forms, enolate ions can be looked at either as vinylic alkoxides (<m:math><m:mrow><m:mtext>C═C−</m:mtext><m:msup><m:mtext>O</m:mtext><m:mo>−</m:mo></m:msup></m:mrow></m:math>) or as <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis>-keto carbanions (<m:math><m:mrow><m:msup><m:mrow/><m:mo>−</m:mo></m:msup><m:mtext>C−C═O</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math>). Thus, enolate ions can react with electrophiles either on oxygen or on carbon. Reaction on oxygen yields an enol derivative, while reaction on carbon yields an <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis>-substituted carbonyl compound (<link target-id="fig-00001"/>). Both kinds of reactivity are known, but reaction on carbon is more common.</para>

<media alt="An illustration shows an electrostatic potential map and 2 chemical reactions. The electrostatic potential map shows a ball-and-stick model containing 3 gray balls representing carbon atom 5 white balls representing hydrogen atoms and 1 red ball representing oxygen atom. The gray balls are connected in a row. The first gray ball is connected to 3 white balls. The second gray ball is connected to a red ball while the third gray ball is connected to 2 white balls. The red ball is shown against a dense red background while the third gray ball is shown against a light red background. The first chemical reaction shows that vinyl alkoxide reacts with electrophile to yield an enol derivative. Vinylic alkoxide is shown exhibiting resonance form with another compound alpha-keto carbanion. The structure of vinylic alkoxide shows a carbon atom having an open bond bonded to an oxygen anion with 3 pairs of electrons and double bonded to a pink carbon having 2 open bonds. When the reaction happens on the oxygen atom in the presence of electrophile it yields an enol derivative that shows a carbon atom having an open bonded bonded to an oxygen atom with 2 pairs of electrons bonded to a green electrophile and double bonded to a pink carbon having 2 open bonds. The alpha-Keto carbanion shows a carbon atom having an open bond bonded to an oxygen with 2 pairs of electrons and single bonded to a pink carbon anion with two electrons and 2 open bonds. When the reaction happens on the pink carbon anion in the presence of electrophile it yields an alpha-substituted carbonyl compound. Its structure shows a carbon atom having an open bond double bonded to a pink oxygen with 2 pairs of electrons and bonded to a pink carbon with 2 open bonds and bonded to a green electrophile.">

<para id="para-00003">As an example of enolate ion reactivity, aldehydes and ketones undergo base-promoted <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis> halogenation. Even relatively weak bases such as hydroxide ion are effective for halogenation because it’s not necessary to convert the ketone completely into its enolate ion. As soon as a small amount of enolate is generated, halogen reacts with it immediately, removing it from the reaction and driving the equilibrium toward further enolate ion formation.</para>

<media alt="An illustration shows a reversible chemical reaction of a carbonyl compound in the presence of sodium hydroxide and water to yield an intermediate compound which in the presence of bromine yields an enolate ion and bromide ion. The structure of the reactant shows a carbonyl group with an open bond bonded to a carbon having 2 open bonds and bonded to a blue hydrogen atom. The structure of the intermediate shows a carbon atom having an open bond bonded to a pink oxygen anion with 3 pairs of electrons and double bonded to a carbon atom having 2 open bonds. The structure of the enolate ion shows a carbonyl group having an open bond bonded to a carbon atom having 2 open bonds and bonded to a green bromine atom.">

<para id="para-00004">Base-promoted halogenation of aldehydes and ketones is seldom used in practice because it’s difficult to stop the reaction at the monosubstituted product. An <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis>-halogenated ketone is generally more acidic than the starting, unsubstituted ketone because of the electron-withdrawing inductive effect of the halogen atom. Thus, the monohalogenated products are themselves rapidly turned into enolate ions and further halogenated.</para>
<para id="para-00005">If excess base and halogen are used, a methyl ketone is triply halogenated and then cleaved by base in the <emphasis effect="italics">haloform reaction.</emphasis> The products are a carboxylic acid plus a so-called haloform (chloroform, CHCl<sub>3</sub>; bromoform, CHBr<sub>3</sub>; or iodoform, CHI<sub>3</sub>). Note that the second step of the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution of <sup>–</sup>CX<sub>3</sub> by <sup>–</sup>OH. That is, a halogen-stabilized carbanion acts as a leaving group.</para>

<media alt="An illustration shows a chemical reaction where a methyl ketone combines with sodium hydroxide and blue X2 where X represents chlorine bromine or iodine to yield a chain of three intermediates. The third intermediate reacts with CX3 to yield a carboxylate ion (RCO bonded to blue oxygen anion) and CHX3 (blue H and pink X). The structure of methyl ketone shows a carbonyl group bonded to R and a methyl group. The first intermediate shows a carbonyl group bonded to an R and CX3. The first intermediate reacts with blue hydroxyl ion that shows six electrons. An arrow from these electrons points to the carbonyl carbon. An arrow from the carbonyl bond points to oxygen. The second intermediate shows a carbon atom bonded to R a pink oxygen anion with 3 pairs of electrons a blue hydroxyl group and CX3 (pink X). An arrow from the electrons of oxygen anion points to the C-O bond. An arrow from the C-CX3 bond points to X3. The third intermediate shows a carbonyl group bonded to R and blue hydroxyl group.">
