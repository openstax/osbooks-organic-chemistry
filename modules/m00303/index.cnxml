<para id="para-00001">We said in <link document="m00221"/> that aldehydes and ketones undergo a rapid and reversible nucleophilic addition reaction with alcohols to form hemiacetals.</para>

<para id="para-00002">If the carbonyl and the hydroxyl group are in the same molecule, an intramolecular nucleophilic addition can take place, leading to the formation of a cyclic hemiacetal. Five- and six-membered cyclic hemiacetals are relatively strain-free and particularly stable, and many carbohydrates therefore exist in an equilibrium between open-chain and cyclic forms. Glucose, for instance, exists in aqueous solution primarily in the six-membered <term id="term-00001">pyranose</term> form resulting from intramolecular nucleophilic addition of the –OH group at C5 to the C1 carbonyl group (<link target-id="fig-00002"/>). The name <emphasis effect="italics">pyranose</emphasis> is derived from <emphasis effect="italics">pyran,</emphasis> the name of the unsaturated six-membered cyclic ether.</para>
<para id="para-00003">Like cyclohexane rings (<link document="m00045"/>), pyranose rings have a chairlike geometry with axial and equatorial substituents. By convention, the rings are usually drawn by placing the hemiacetal oxygen atom at the right rear, as shown in <link target-id="fig-00002"/>. Note that an –OH group on the right in a Fischer projection is on the bottom face of the pyranose ring, and an –OH group on the left in a Fischer projection is on the top face of the ring. For <emphasis effect="smallcaps">D</emphasis> sugars, the terminal –CH<sub>2</sub>OH group is on the top of the ring, whereas for <emphasis effect="smallcaps">L</emphasis> sugars, the –CH<sub>2</sub>OH group is on the bottom.</para>
<para id="para-00004">When an open-chain monosaccharide cyclizes to a pyranose form, a new chirality center is generated at the former carbonyl carbon and two diastereomers, called <term id="term-00002">anomers</term>, are produced. The hemiacetal carbon atom is referred to as the <term id="term-00003">anomeric center</term>. For example, glucose cyclizes reversibly in aqueous solution to a 37 : 63 mixture of two anomers (<link target-id="fig-00002"/>). The compound with its newly generated –OH group at C1 cis to the –OH at the lowest chirality center in a Fischer projection is called the <term id="term-00004"><emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis> anomer</term>; its full name is <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis>-<emphasis effect="smallcaps">D</emphasis>-glucopyranose. The compound with its newly generated –OH group trans to the –OH at the lowest chirality center is called the <term id="term-00005"><emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis> anomer</term>; its full name is <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-<emphasis effect="smallcaps">D</emphasis>-glucopyranose. Note that in <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-<emphasis effect="smallcaps">D</emphasis>-glucopyranose, all the substituents on the ring are equatorial. Thus, <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-<emphasis effect="smallcaps">D</emphasis>-glucopyranose is the least sterically crowded and most stable of the eight <emphasis effect="smallcaps">D</emphasis> aldohexoses.</para>

<para id="para-00005">Some monosaccharides also exist in a five-membered cyclic hemiacetal form called a <term id="term-00006">furanose</term>. <emphasis effect="smallcaps">D</emphasis>-Fructose, for instance, exists in water solution as 68% <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-pyranose, 2.7% <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis>-pyranose, 0.5% open-chain, 22.4% <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-furanose, and 6.2% <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis>-furanose. The pyranose form results from addition of the –OH at C6 to the carbonyl group, while the furanose form results from addition of the –OH at C5 to the carbonyl group (<link target-id="fig-00003"/>).</para>

<para id="para-00006">Both anomers of <emphasis effect="smallcaps">D</emphasis>-glucopyranose can be crystallized and purified. Pure <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis>-<emphasis effect="smallcaps">D</emphasis>-glucopyranose has a melting point of 146 °C and a specific rotation [<emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis>]<sub>D</sub> = +112.2; pure <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-<emphasis effect="smallcaps">D</emphasis>-glucopyranose has a melting point of 148 to 155 °C and a specific rotation [<emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis>]<sub>D</sub> = +18.7. When a sample of either pure anomer is dissolved in water, however, its optical rotation slowly changes until it reaches a constant value of +52.6. That is, the specific rotation of the <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis>-anomer solution decreases from +112.2 to +52.6, and the specific rotation of the <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-anomer solution increases from +18.7 to +52.6. Called <term id="term-00007">mutarotation</term>, this change in optical rotation is due to the slow interconversion of the pure anomers to give the same 37 : 63 equilibrium mixture.</para>
<para id="para-00007">Mutarotation occurs by a reversible ring-opening of each anomer to the open-chain aldehyde, followed by reclosure. Although the equilibration is slow at neutral pH, it is catalyzed by both acid and base.</para>
