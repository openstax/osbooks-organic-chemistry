<para id="para-00001">In addition to enolate ions, other kinds of carbon nucleophiles also add to <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis>,<emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-unsaturated acceptors in Michael-like reactions. Among the most important and useful of such nucleophiles, particularly in biological chemistry, are <emphasis effect="italics">enamines,</emphasis> which are readily prepared by reaction between a ketone and a secondary amine (<link document="m00219"/>). For example:</para>

<para id="para-00002">As the following resonance structures indicate, enamines are electronically similar to enolate ions. Overlap of the nitrogen lone-pair orbital with the double-bond <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbitals leads to an increase in electron density on the <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis> carbon atom, making that carbon nucleophilic. An electrostatic potential map of <emphasis effect="italics">N,N</emphasis>-dimethylaminoethylene shows this shift of electron density (red) toward the <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis> position.</para>

<para id="para-00003">Enamines behave in much the same way as enolate ions and enter into many of the same kinds of reactions. In the <term id="term-00001">Stork enamine reaction</term>, named for its discoverer, Gilbert Stork of Columbia University, for example, an enamine adds to an <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis>,<emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-unsaturated carbonyl acceptor in a Michael-like process. The initial product is then hydrolyzed by aqueous acid to yield a 1,5-dicarbonyl compound. The overall reaction is thus a three-step sequence of (<emphasis effect="bold"><span class="magenta-text">1</span></emphasis>) enamine formation from a ketone, (<emphasis effect="bold"><span class="magenta-text">2</span></emphasis>) Michael addition to an <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis>,<emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-unsaturated carbonyl compound, and (<emphasis effect="bold"><span class="magenta-text">3</span></emphasis>) enamine hydrolysis back to a ketone.</para>
<para id="para-00004">The net effect of the Stork enamine reaction is the Michael addition of a ketone to an <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis>,<emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-unsaturated carbonyl compound. For example, cyclohexanone reacts with the cyclic amine pyrrolidine to yield an enamine; further reaction with an enone such as 3-buten-2-one yields a Michael adduct; and aqueous hydrolysis completes the sequence to give a 1,5-diketone (<link target-id="fig-00003"/>).</para>

<para id="para-00005">The enamine–Michael reaction has two advantages over the enolate-ion–Michael reaction that makes it particularly useful in biological pathways. First, an enamine is neutral, easily prepared, and easily handled, while an enolate ion is charged, sometimes difficult to prepare, and must be handled carefully. Second, an enamine from a <emphasis effect="italics">mono</emphasis>ketone can be used in the Michael addition, whereas only enolate ions from <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-dicarbonyl compounds can be used.</para>
