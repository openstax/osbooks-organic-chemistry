<para id="para-00001">The aldol reactions weâ€™ve seen thus far have all been <emphasis effect="italics">intermolecular</emphasis>, meaning that they have taken place between two different molecules. When certain <emphasis effect="italics">di</emphasis>carbonyl compounds are treated with base, however, an <emphasis effect="italics">intramolecular</emphasis> aldol reaction can occur, leading to the formation of a cyclic product. For example, base treatment of a 1,4-diketone such as 2,5-hexanedione yields a cyclopentenone product, and base treatment of a 1,5-diketone such as 2,6-heptanedione yields a cyclohexenone.</para>

<para id="para-00002">The mechanism of intramolecular aldol reactions is similar to that of intermolecular reactions. The only difference is that both the nucleophilic carbonyl anion donor and the electrophilic carbonyl acceptor are now in the same molecule. One complication, however, is that intramolecular aldol reactions might lead to a mixture of products, depending on which enolate ion is formed. For example, 2,5-hexanedione might yield either the five-membered-ring product 3-methyl-2-cyclopentenone or the three-membered-ring product (2-methylcyclopropenyl) ethanone (<link target-id="fig-00002"/>). In practice, though, only the cyclopentenone is formed.</para>
<figure class="scaled-down" id="fig-00002">
<media alt="The reaction shows formation of 3-methyl-2-cyclopentenone through path a, from 2,5-hexanedione, using sodium hydroxide and water. Path b converts the same starting material using same reagents to (2-methylcyclopropenyl)ethanone (not formed).">

<para id="para-00003">The selectivity observed in the intramolecular aldol reaction of 2,5-hexanedione is due to the fact that all steps in the mechanism are reversible, so an equilibrium is reached. Thus, the relatively strain-free cyclopentenone product is considerably more stable than the highly strained cyclopropene alternative. For similar reasons, intramolecular aldol reactions of 1,5-diketones lead only to cyclohexenone products rather than to the more strained acylcyclobutenes.</para>
