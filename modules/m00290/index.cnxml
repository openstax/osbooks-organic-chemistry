<para id="para-00001">The bonding in alkylamines is similar to the bonding in ammonia. The nitrogen atom is <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup>-hybridized, with its three substituents occupying three corners of a regular tetrahedron and the lone pair of electrons occupying the fourth corner. As you might expect, the C–N–C bond angles are close to the 109° tetrahedral value. For trimethylamine, the C–N–C bond angle is 108° and the C–N bond length is 147 pm.</para>

<para id="para-00002">One consequence of tetrahedral geometry is that an amine with three different substituents on nitrogen is chiral, as we saw in <link document="m00059"/>. Unlike chiral carbon compounds, however, chiral amines can’t usually be resolved because the two enantiomeric forms rapidly interconvert by a <emphasis effect="italics">pyramidal inversion</emphasis>, much as an alkyl halide inverts in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction. Pyramidal inversion occurs by a momentary rehybridization of the nitrogen atom to planar, <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>2</sup> geometry, followed by rehybridization of the planar intermediate to tetrahedral, <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup> geometry (<link target-id="fig-00002"/>). The barrier to inversion is about 25 kJ/mol (6 kcal/mol), an amount only twice as large as the barrier to rotation about a C–C single bond.</para>

<para id="para-00003">Alkylamines have a variety of applications in the chemical industry as starting materials for the preparation of insecticides and pharmaceuticals. Labetalol, for instance, a so-called <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-blocker used for the treatment of high blood pressure, is prepared by S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction of an epoxide with a primary amine. The substance marketed for drug use is a mixture of all four possible stereoisomers, but the biological activity results primarily from the (<emphasis effect="italics">R</emphasis>,<emphasis effect="italics">R</emphasis>) isomer.</para>

<para id="para-00004">Like alcohols, amines with fewer than five carbon atoms are generally water-soluble. Also like alcohols, primary and secondary amines form hydrogen bonds and are highly associated. As a result, amines have higher boiling points than alkanes of similar molecular weight. Diethylamine (MW = 73 amu) boils at 56.3 °C, for instance, while pentane (MW = 72 amu) boils at 36.1 °C.</para>

<para id="para-00005">One other characteristic of amines is their odor. Low-molecular-weight amines such as trimethylamine have a distinctive fishlike aroma, while diamines such as cadaverine (1,5-pentanediamine) and putrescine (1,4-butanediamine) have the appalling odors you might expect from their common names. Both of these diamines arise from the decomposition of decaying tissue.</para>
