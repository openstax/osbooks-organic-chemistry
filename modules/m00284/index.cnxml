<para id="para-00001">Intramolecular Claisen condensations can be carried out with diesters, just as intramolecular aldol condensations can be carried out with diketones (<link document="m00281"/>). Called the <term id="term-00001">Dieckmann cyclization</term>, this reaction works best on 1,6-diesters and 1,7-diesters. Intramolecular Claisen cyclization of a 1,6-diester gives a five-membered cyclic <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-keto ester, and cyclization of a 1,7-diester gives a six-membered cyclic <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-keto ester.</para>

<media alt="An illustration shows two chemical reactions. The first chemical reaction shows Diethyl hexanedioate (a 1 6-diester) reacting in the presence of sodium ethoxide ethanol and hydronium ion to yield Ethyl 2-oxocyclopentanecarboxylate (82 percent) and ethoxide. The structure of Diethyl hexanedioate (a 1 6-diester) shows a cyclohexanone ring double bonded to oxygen atom at its top (C1). C2 has green ethoxide. C2-C3 bond is not close and shown bent downwards at C3. The C2 position that is bent downwards is double bonded to a blue oxygen atom and bonded to a blue ethoxide group. The structure of Ethyl 2-oxocyclopentanecarboxylate (82 percent) shows a cyclopentanone ring double bonded to an oxygen atm at C1 bonded at C2 to a blue carbon double bonded to an oxygen atom and bonded to a blue ethoxide group. The second product ethanol shows a green ethyl and oxygen and blue hydrogen. The second chemical reaction shows Diethyl heptanedioate (a 1 7-diester) reacting in the presence of sodium ethoxide ethanol and hydronium ion to yield Ethyl 2-oxocyclopentanecarboxylate and ethoxide. The structure of Diethyl heptanedioate (a 1 7-diester) shows a cycloheptanone ring with the same bonding as shown in Diethyl hexanedioate (a 1 6-diester). The structure of the products are same as shown in the first chemical reaction.">

<para id="para-00002">The mechanism of the Dieckmann cyclization, shown in <link target-id="fig-00002"/>, is the same as that of the Claisen condensation. One of the two ester groups is converted into an enolate ion, which carries out a nucleophilic acyl substitution on the second ester group at the other end of the molecule. A cyclic <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-keto ester product results.</para>

<title>MECHANISM</title>
<media alt="An illustration shows the 5 steps of the Dieckmann cyclization of a 1 7-diester to yield a cyclic beta-keto ester product. An illustration in step 1 shows a cycloheptanone double bonded to an oxygen atom at its top (C1). The bond between C2-C3 is missing. C2 is bonded to a green ethoxide. C3 is bonded to 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 blue ethyl acetate. It goes through a reversible reaction in the presence of sodium ethoxide. The supporting text in this step reads “Base abstracts an acidic alpha proton from the carbon atom next to one of the ester groups yielding an enolate ion.” An illustration in step 2 shows the intermediate of the reaction in step 1. The structure of the first product is a cycloheptanone double bonded at C1 to an oxygen atom with 2 pairs of electrons. The bond between C2-C3 is missing. C2 is bonded to a green ethoxide. C3 is negatively charged with a lone pair of electrons and is bonded to a blue hydrogen ion and blue ethyl acetate. A pink curved arrow is shown from the electron pair at C3 to C1; an arrow from the double bond between C1 and oxygen points to oxygen. The second product shown here is ethanol. The supporting text reads “Intramolecular nucleophilic addition of the ester enolate ion to the carbonyl group of the second ester at the other end of the chain then gives a cyclic tetrahedral intermediate.” The intermediate of the reversible reaction in step 2 yields the products in step 3. The structure of the first product shows a cyclohexane bonded at C1 to an oxygen anion with 3 pairs of electrons and a green ethoxide. C2 is bonded to a at C1 and bonded to a blue hydrogen and blue ethyl acetate group. A pink curved arrow is shown from an electron pair of the oxygen to the bond between the oxygen and the C1; an arrow from the bond between C1 and green ethoxide points to ethoxide. This intermediate undergoes a reversible chemical reaction to yield the products shown in step 4. The supporting text in step 3 reads “Loss of alkoxide ion from the tetrahedral intermediate forms a cyclic beta keto ester. The first intermediate of step 3 shows a cyclohexanone double bonded to an oxygen atom at C1 (top) and bonded to a blue hydrogen and blue ethyl acetate at C2. The second intermediate shown is a green ethoxide anion with 3 pairs of electrons. A pink curved arrow is shown from an electron pair of ethoxide to the hydrogen atom; and an arrow from the bond between C2 and hydrogen points to C2. These intermediaries undergo a chemical reaction to yield the next set of intermediaries in step 4. The structure of the first intermediate shows a cyclohexanone double bonded to an oxygen atom at C1 and bonded at C2 to a blue ethyl acetate. C2 is shown carrying a negative charge with a lone pair of electrons. The second intermediate is ethanol where ethyl and oxygen are shown in green and hydrogen is shown in blue. The supporting text in step 4 reads “Deprotonation of the acidic beta keto ester gives an enolate ion . . “ These intermediaries undergo a chemical reaction in the presence of hydronium ion to yield the final products shown in step 5. The first product shows a cyclohexanone structure double bonded to an oxygen atom at C1 (top) and bonded at C2 to a pink hydrogen and a blue ethyl acetate. The second product is a pink water molecule. The supporting text in step 5 reads “. . . which is protonated by addition of aqueous acid at the end of the reaction to generate the neutral beta keto ester product.”">

<media alt="An illustration shows a chemical reaction where Ethyl 2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylate in the presence of sodium ethoxide and an allylbromide (allyl shown in green and bromine in pink) yields an intermediate 2-alkylcyclohexanone which in the presence of hydronium ion upon heating yields 2-Allylcyclohexanone (83 percent) pink carbon dioxide and ethanol. The structure of Ethyl 2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylate shows a cyclohexanone bonded to a hydrogen atom and COOEt at C2. The structure of 2-alkylcyclohexanone shows a cyclohexanone bonded to COOEt (pink) and an alkyl group (green) at C2. The alkyl group shows methylene group bonded to a methine group that is double bonded to a methylene group.
