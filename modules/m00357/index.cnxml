<para id="para-00001">Polymers aren’t really that different from other organic molecules. They’re much larger, of course, but their chemistry is similar to that of analogous small molecules. Thus, the alkane chains of polyethylene undergo radical-initiated halogenation, the aromatic rings of polystyrene undergo typical electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, and the amide linkages of nylon are hydrolyzed by aqueous base.</para>
<para id="para-00002">The major difference between small and large organic molecules is in their physical properties. For instance, their large size means that polymers experience substantially greater van der Waals forces than do small molecules (<link document="m00029"/>). But because van der Waals forces operate only at close distances, they are strongest in polymers like high-density polyethylene, in which chains can pack together closely in a regular way. Many polymers, in fact, have regions that are essentially crystalline. These regions, called <term id="term-00001">crystallites</term>, consist of highly ordered portions in which the zigzag polymer chains are held together by van der Waals forces (<link target-id="fig-00001"/>).</para>

<para id="para-00003">As you might expect, polymer crystallinity is strongly affected by the steric requirements of substituent groups on the chains. Linear polyethylene is highly crystalline, but poly(methyl methacrylate) is noncrystalline because the chains can’t pack closely together in a regular way. Polymers with a high degree of crystallinity are generally hard and durable. When heated, the crystalline regions melt at the <term id="term-00002">melt transition temperature, <emphasis effect="italics">T</emphasis><sub>m</sub></term>, to give an amorphous material.</para>
<para id="para-00004">Noncrystalline, amorphous polymers like poly(methyl methacrylate), sold under the trade name Plexiglas, have little or no long-range ordering among chains but can nevertheless be very hard at room temperature. When heated, the hard amorphous polymer becomes soft and flexible at a point called the <term id="term-00003">glass transition temperature, <emphasis effect="italics">T</emphasis><sub>g</sub></term>. Much of the art in polymer synthesis lies in finding methods for controlling the degree of crystallinity and the glass transition temperature, thereby imparting useful properties to the polymer.</para>
<para id="para-00005">In general, polymers can be divided into four major categories, depending on their physical behavior: <emphasis effect="italics">thermoplastics, fibers, elastomers,</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">thermosetting resins</emphasis>. <term id="term-00004">Thermoplastics</term> are the polymers most people think of when the word <emphasis effect="italics">plastic</emphasis> is mentioned. These polymers have a high glass transition temperature and are therefore hard at room temperature but become soft and viscous when heated. As a result, they can be molded into toys, beads, telephone housings, or any of a thousand other items. Because thermoplastics have little or no cross-linking, the individual chains can slip past one another in the melt. Some thermoplastic polymers, such as poly(methyl methacrylate) and polystyrene, are amorphous and noncrystalline; others, such as polyethylene and nylon, are partially crystalline. Among the better-known thermoplastics is poly(ethylene terephthalate), or PET, used for making plastic soft-drink bottles.</para>

<para id="para-00006"><term id="term-00005">Plasticizers</term>—small organic molecules that act as lubricants between chains—are usually added to thermoplastics to keep them from becoming brittle at room temperature. An example is poly(vinyl chloride), which is brittle when pure but becomes supple and pliable when a plasticizer is added. In fact, most drip bags used in hospitals to deliver intravenous saline solutions are made of poly(vinyl chloride), although replacements such as polypropylene are appearing.</para>
<para id="para-00007">Dialkyl phthalates such as di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (generally called dioctyl phthalate) are commonly used as plasticizers, although questions about their safety have been raised. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has advised the use of alternative materials in compromised patients and infants but has found no evidence of toxicity for healthy individuals. In addition, children’s toys that contain phthalates have been banned in the United States.</para>

<para id="para-00008"><term id="term-00006">Fibers</term> are thin threads produced by extruding a molten polymer through small holes in a die, or spinneret. The fibers are then cooled and drawn out, which orients the crystallite regions along the axis of the fiber and adds considerable tensile strength <link target-id="fig-00004"/>. Nylon, Dacron, and polyethylene all have the semicrystalline structure necessary for being drawn into oriented fibers.</para>

<para id="para-00009"><term id="term-00007">Elastomers</term> are amorphous polymers that have the ability to stretch out and spring back to their original shapes. These polymers must have low glass transition temperatures and a small amount of cross-linking to prevent the chains from slipping over one another. In addition, the chains must have an irregular shape to prevent crystallite formation. When stretched, the randomly coiled chains straighten out and orient along the direction of the pull. Van der Waals forces are too weak and too few to maintain this orientation, however, and the elastomer therefore reverts to its random coiled state when the stretching force is released (<link target-id="fig-00005"/>).</para>
<figure id="fig-00005" class="scaled-down">
<media alt="An illustration shows two images. The first image shows unstretched form of an elastomer which is stretched to form the second image that relaxes to yield the first image.

<para id="para-00010">Natural rubber (<link document="m00176"/>) is the most common example of an elastomer. Rubber has the long chains and occasional cross-links needed for elasticity, but its irregular geometry prevents close packing of the chains into crystallites. Gutta-percha, by contrast, is highly crystalline and is not an elastomer (<link target-id="fig-00006"/>).</para>

<para id="para-00011"><term id="term-00008">Thermosetting resins</term> are polymers that become highly cross-linked and solidify into a hard, insoluble mass when heated. Bakelite, a thermosetting resin first produced in 1907, has been in commercial use longer than any other synthetic polymer. It is widely used for molded parts, adhesives, coatings, and even high-temperature applications such as missile nose cones.</para>
<para id="para-00012">Chemically, Bakelite is a <emphasis effect="italics">phenolic resin</emphasis>, produced by reaction of phenol and formaldehyde. On heating, water is eliminated, many cross-links form, and the polymer sets into a rocklike mass. The cross-linking in Bakelite and other thermosetting resins is three-dimensional and is so extensive that we can’t really speak of polymer “chains.” A piece of Bakelite is essentially one large molecule.</para>

<para id="para-00017">Frequently, however, plastics are simply thrown away rather than recycled, and much work has therefore been carried out on developing biodegradable polymers, which can be broken down by soil microorganisms. Among the most common biodegradable polymers are polyglycolic acid (PGA), polylactic acid (PLA), and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). All are polyesters and are therefore susceptible to hydrolysis of their ester links. Copolymers of PGA with PLA have found a particularly wide range of uses. A 90/10 copolymer of polyglycolic acid with polylactic acid is used to make absorbable sutures that are degraded and absorbed by the body within 90 days after surgery.</para>

<para id="para-00018">Biodegradation is important, but even better than the breakdown of a small group of specialized polymers would be the development of a generalized method of breakdown that could be used on any polymer, including even hydrocarbon polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene. Such a method has recently been reported by chemists at the University of Delaware, using hydrogen at 200 °C and 2 atm pressure in the presence of an organozirconium catalyst to turn polyethylene into simple hydrocarbons. The method uses a large amount of hydrogen at present, but it is an impressive start.</para>

<title>Summary</title>
<para id="para-00019">Synthetic polymers can be classified as either chain-growth or step-growth. Chain-growth polymers are prepared by chain-reaction polymerization of vinyl monomers in the presence of a radical, an anion, or a cation initiator. Radical polymerization is sometimes used, but alkenes such as 2-methylpropene that have electron-donating substituents on the double bond polymerize easily by a cationic route through carbocation intermediates. Similarly, monomers such as methyl <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis>-cyanoacrylate that have electron-withdrawing substituents on the double bond polymerize by an anionic, conjugate addition pathway.</para>
<para id="para-00020">Copolymerization of two monomers gives a product with properties different from those of either homopolymer. <emphasis effect="bold">Graft copolymers</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="bold">block copolymers</emphasis> are two examples.</para>
<para id="para-00021">Alkene polymerization can be carried out in a controlled manner using a <emphasis effect="bold">Ziegler–Natta catalyst</emphasis>. Ziegler–Natta polymerization minimizes the amount of chain branching in the polymer and leads to stereoregular chains—either <emphasis effect="bold">isotactic</emphasis> (substituents on the same side of the chain) or <emphasis effect="bold">syndiotactic</emphasis> (substituents on alternate sides of the chain), rather than <emphasis effect="bold">atactic</emphasis> (substituents randomly disposed).</para>
<para id="para-00022">Step-growth polymers, the second major class of polymers, are prepared by reactions between difunctional molecules, with individual bonds in the polymer formed independently of one another. <emphasis effect="bold">Polycarbonates</emphasis> are formed from a diester and a diol, and <emphasis effect="bold">polyurethanes</emphasis> are formed from a diisocyanate and a diol.</para>
<para id="para-00023">The chemistry of synthetic polymers is similar to the chemistry of small molecules with the same functional groups, but the physical properties of polymers are greatly affected by size. Polymers can be classified by physical property into four groups: <emphasis effect="bold">thermoplastics</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="bold">fibers</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="bold">elastomers</emphasis>, and <emphasis effect="bold">thermosetting resins</emphasis>. The properties of each group can be accounted for by the structure, the degree of crystallinity, and the amount of cross-linking they contain.</para>
