    <para id="para-00001">Now that we know how S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions occur, we need to see how they can be used and what variables affect them. Some S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let’s begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.</para>
    <para id="para-00002">The rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy ∆<emphasis effect="italics">G</emphasis><sup>‡</sup>, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect ∆<emphasis effect="italics">G</emphasis><sup>‡</sup> either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases ∆<emphasis effect="italics">G</emphasis><sup>‡</sup> and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or decreasing the transition-state energy decreases ∆<emphasis effect="italics">G</emphasis><sup>‡</sup> and increases the reaction rate (<link target-id="fig-00001"/>). We’ll see examples of all these effects as we look at S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction variables.</para>
    <figure class="scaled-down" id="fig-00001">
    <media alt="An illustration shows two graphs. In both graphs the x axes plot the reaction progress in increasing order and the y axes plot the increasing energy level. Each graph shows two curves (pink and black). In all the curves the vertical distance between the starting point and peak is labeled delta G double dagger. In the first graph the curves overlap. In the second graph the curves start at the same point but the peak of the pink curve is higher than the peak of the black curve.">

    <title>Steric Effects in the S<sub>N</sub>2 Reaction</title>
    <para id="para-00003">The first S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction variable to look at is the structure of the substrate. Because the S<sub>N</sub>2 transition state involves partial bond formation between the incoming nucleophile and the alkyl halide carbon atom, it seems reasonable that a hindered, bulky substrate should prevent easy approach of the nucleophile, making bond formation difficult. In other words, the transition state for reaction of a sterically hindered substrate, whose carbon atom is “shielded” from the approach of the incoming nucleophile, is higher in energy and forms more slowly than the corresponding transition state for a less hindered substrate (<link target-id="fig-00002"/>).</para>

    <para id="para-00004">As <link target-id="fig-00002"/> shows, the difficulty of nucleophile approach increases as the three substituents bonded to the halo-substituted carbon atom increase in size. Methyl halides are by far the most reactive substrates in S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, followed by primary alkyl halides such as ethyl and propyl. Alkyl branching at the reacting center, as in isopropyl halides (2°), slows the reaction greatly, and further branching, as in <emphasis effect="italics">tert</emphasis>-butyl halides (3°), effectively halts the reaction. Even branching one carbon away from the reacting center, as in 2,2-dimethylpropyl <emphasis effect="italics">(neopentyl)</emphasis> halides, greatly hinders nucleophilic displacement. As a result, S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions occur only at relatively unhindered sites and are normally useful only with methyl halides, primary halides, and a few simple secondary halides. Relative reactivities for some different substrates are as follows:</para>

    <para id="para-00009">What are the reasons for the reactivity differences observed in <link target-id="table-00001"/>? Why do some reactants appear to be much more “nucleophilic” than others? The answers to these questions aren’t straightforward. Part of the problem is that the term <emphasis effect="italics">nucleophilicity</emphasis> is imprecise. The term is usually taken to be a measure of the affinity of a nucleophile for a carbon atom in the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, but the reactivity of a given nucleophile can change from one reaction to the next. The exact nucleophilicity of a species in a given reaction depends on the substrate, the solvent, and even the reactant concentrations. Detailed explanations for the observed nucleophilicities aren’t always simple, but some trends can be detected from the data of <link target-id="table-00001"/>.</para>
    <list id="list-00001">
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Nucleophilicity roughly parallels basicity</emphasis> when comparing nucleophiles that have the same reacting atom. Thus, OH<sup>–</sup> is both more basic and more nucleophilic than acetate ion, CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>–</sup>, which in turn is more basic and more nucleophilic than H<sub>2</sub>O. Since “nucleophilicity” is usually taken as the affinity of a Lewis base for a carbon atom in the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction and “basicity” is the affinity of a base for a proton, it’s easy to see why there might be a correlation between the two kinds of behavior.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Nucleophilicity usually increases going down a column of the periodic table.</emphasis> Thus, HS<sup>–</sup> is more nucleophilic than HO<sup>–</sup>, and the halide reactivity order is I<sup>–</sup> > Br<sup>–</sup> > Cl<sup>–</sup>. Going down the periodic table, elements have their valence electrons in successively larger shells where they are successively farther from the nucleus, less tightly held, and consequently more reactive. This matter is complex, though, and the nucleophilicity order can change depending on the solvent.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Negatively charged nucleophiles are usually more reactive than neutral ones.</emphasis> As a result, S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions are often carried out under basic conditions rather than neutral or acidic conditions.</item>

    <title>The Leaving Group</title>
    <para id="para-00015">Still another variable that can affect the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction is the nature of the group displaced by the incoming nucleophile, the <term id="term-00001">leaving group</term>. Because the leaving group is expelled with a negative charge in most S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, the best leaving groups are those that best stabilize the negative charge in the transition state. The greater the extent of charge stabilization by the leaving group, the lower the energy of the transition state and the more rapid the reaction. But as we saw in <link document="m00025"/>, the groups that best stabilize a negative charge are also the weakest bases. Thus, weak bases such as Cl<sup>–</sup>, Br<sup>–</sup>, and tosylate ion make good leaving groups, while strong bases such as OH<sup>–</sup> and NH<sub>2</sub><sup>–</sup> make poor leaving groups.</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows the increasing leaving group reactivity of 6 compounds in the following order with the relative reactivity: group of hydroxyl ion amino group and OR minus (very less than 1) fluoride ion (1) chloride ion (200) bromide ion (10 000) iodide ion (30 000) and TosO minus (60 000).">

In other words, alkyl fluorides, alcohols, ethers, and amines do not typically undergo S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions. To carry out an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction with an alcohol, it’s necessary to convert the <sup>–</sup>OH into a better leaving group.

    <para id="para-00022">In contrast with protic solvents—which decrease the rates of S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions by lowering the ground-state energy of the nucleophile—polar aprotic solvents increase the rates of S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions by raising the ground-state energy of the nucleophile. Acetonitrile (CH<sub>3</sub>CN), dimethylformamide [(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NCHO, abbreviated DMF], and dimethyl sulfoxide [(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO, abbreviated DMSO] are particularly useful. A solvent known as hexamethylphosphoramide {[(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>N]<sub>3</sub>PO, abbreviated HMPA} can also be useful but it should only be handled with great care and not be allowed to touch the eyes or skin. These solvents can dissolve many salts because of their high polarity, but they tend to solvate metal cations rather than nucleophilic anions. As a result, the bare, unsolvated anions have a greater nucleophilicity and S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions take place at correspondingly increased rates. For instance, a rate increase of 200,000 has been observed on changing from methanol to HMPA for the reaction of azide ion with 1-bromobutane.</para>

In the second graph the pink curve represents good nucleophile and black curve represents poor nucleophile; the curves overlap. In the third graph the pink curve represents good leaving group and black curve represents poor leaving group; the curves are similar to the curves in the first graph.
