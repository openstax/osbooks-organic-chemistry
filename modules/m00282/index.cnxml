<para id="para-00001">Esters, like aldehydes and ketones, are weakly acidic. When an ester with an <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis> hydrogen is treated with 1 equivalent of a base such as sodium ethoxide, a reversible carbonyl condensation reaction occurs to yield a <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-keto ester. For instance, ethyl acetate yields ethyl acetoacetate on base treatment. This reaction between two ester molecules is known as the <term id="term-00001">Claisen condensation reaction</term>. (We’ll use ethyl esters, abbreviated “Et,” for consistency, but other esters will also work.)</para>

<media alt="An illustration shows a chemical reaction where 2 ethyl acetate moles combine in the presence of sodium ethoxide ethanol and hydronium ion and yields Ethyl acetoacetate a beta-keto ester (75%) and ethanol. The structure of ethylacetate shows a central carbon atom bonded to a methyl group double bonded to an oxygen atom and bonded to ethoxide. A similar structure is shown as the second reactant. The structure of Ethyl acetoacetate a beta keto ester (75%) shows a methyl group bonded to a carbonyl group whose carbon is bonded to a methylene group bonded to a carbonyl group bonded to an ethoxide group. The structure of ethanol shows a methyl group bonded to a methylene group bonded to a hydroxide group.">

<para id="para-00002">The mechanism of the Claisen condensation is similar to that of the aldol condensation and involves the nucleophilic addition of an ester enolate ion to the carbonyl group of a second ester molecule (<link>Figure 23_07_OChem-23-07-002_80485-23-04_MechTwo</link>). The only difference between the aldol condensation of an aldehyde or ketone and the Claisen condensation of an ester involves the fate of the initially formed tetrahedral intermediate. The tetrahedral intermediate in the aldol reaction is protonated to give an alcohol product—exactly the behavior previously seen for aldehydes and ketones (<link document="m00215"/>). The tetrahedral intermediate in the Claisen reaction, however, expels an alkoxide leaving group to yield an acyl substitution product—as previously seen for esters (<link document="m00244"/>).</para>

<title>MECHANISM</title>
<media alt="An illustration shows the 5 steps involved in the mechanism of Claisen condensation reaction. The structure in step 1 shows a carbon atom bonded to 3 hydrogen atoms and bonded to a carbonyl group bonded to a green ethoxide. A pink curved arrow is shown from a blue ethoxide anion with 3 pairs of electrons to one of the hydrogen atoms bonded to the carbon; and an arrow from the bond between that hydrogen atom and the carbon atom points to the carbon. This structure is shown undergoing a reversible chemical reaction. The supporting text for step 1 reads “Base abstracts an acidic alpha hydrogen atom from an ester molecule yielding an ester enolate ion.” The second step shows the first intermediate of this reaction. Two structures are shown here. The first structure shows a carbon atom bonded to 3 hydrogen atoms bonded to a carbonyl group (oxygen atom with 2 pairs of electrons) bonded to a green ethoxide group. The second structure shows a carbon anion with a pair of electrons bonded to 2 hydrogen atoms bonded to a carbonyl group bonded to a green ethoxide group. A pink curved arrow is shown from the carbon anion of the second structure to the carbon of the carbonyl group in the first structure; and an arrow from the double bond between the carbon and oxygen of the carbonyl group points to the oxygen atom. This intermediate is shown undergoing a reversible chemical reaction. The supporting text in step 2 reads “The enolate ion is added in a nucleophilic addition reaction to a second ester molecule giving a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.” The structure of the second intermediate is shown in step 3. It shows a carbon atom bonded to a methyl group green ethoxide a pink oxygen anion with 3 pairs of electrons and a methylene group bonded to a carbonyl group bonded to green ethoxide. A pink curved arrow is shown from the electron pair of the oxygen anion to the bond between it and the carbon atom; and an arrow from the bond between the first carbon and the green ethoxide points to green ethoxide. The supporting text in step 3 reads “The tetrahedral intermediate expels ethoxide ion to yield a new carbonyl compound ethyl acetoacetate.” This structure undergoes a reversible chemical reaction which yields a third intermediate and a green ethoxide anion in step 4. Its structure shows a methyl group bonded to a carbonyl group bonded to a methylene group bonded to a carbonyl group bonded to a green ethoxide. The supporting text in step 4 reads “But ethoxide ion is a strong enough base to deprotonate ethyl acetoacetate shifting the equilibrium and driving the overall reaction to completion.” This structure undergoes a reversible chemical reaction which shows a methyl group bonded to a carbonyl group bonded to a carbon anion with a pair of electrons bonded to a hydrogen atom and bonded to a carbonyl group bonded to a green ethoxide group. The other intermediate is green ethoxide. This intermediate in the presence of hydronium ion yields a beta keto ester product. Its structure shows a methyl group bonded to a carbonyl group bonded to a methylene group bonded to a carbonyl group bonded to a green ethoxide. The supporting text in step 5 yields “Protonation of the enolate ion by addition of aqueous acid in a separate step yields the final -keto ester product.”">

<para id="para-00003">If the starting ester has more than one acidic <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis> hydrogen, the product <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-keto ester has a highly acidic, doubly activated hydrogen atom that can be abstracted by base. This deprotonation of the product requires the use of a full equivalent of base rather than a catalytic amount. Furthermore, the deprotonation serves to drive the equilibrium completely to the product side so that high yields are usually obtained in Claisen condensations.</para>
