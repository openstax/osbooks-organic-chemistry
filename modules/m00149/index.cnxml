    <para id="para-00001">In the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra we’ve seen thus far, each different kind of proton in a molecule has given rise to a single peak. It often happens, though, that the absorption of a proton splits into multiple peaks, called a <term id="term-00001">multiplet</term>. For example, in the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of bromoethane shown in <link target-id="fig-00001"/>, the –CH<sub>2</sub>Br protons appear as four peaks (a <emphasis effect="italics">quartet</emphasis>) centered at 3.42 <emphasis effect="italics">δ</emphasis> and the –CH<sub>3</sub> protons appear as three peaks (a <emphasis effect="italics">triplet</emphasis>) centered at 1.68 <emphasis effect="italics">δ</emphasis>.</para>

    <para id="para-00002">Called <term id="term-00002">spin–spin splitting</term>, multiple absorptions of a nucleus are caused by the interaction, or <term id="term-00003">coupling</term>, of the spins of nearby nuclei. In other words, the tiny magnetic field produced by one nucleus affects the magnetic field felt by a neighboring nucleus. Look at the –CH<sub>3</sub> protons in bromoethane, for example. The three equivalent –CH<sub>3</sub> protons are neighbored by two other magnetic nuclei—the two protons on the adjacent –CH<sub>2</sub>Br group. Each of the neighboring –CH<sub>2</sub>Br protons has its own nuclear spin, which can align either with or against the applied field, producing a tiny effect that is felt by the –CH<sub>3</sub> protons.</para>
    <para id="para-00003">There are three ways in which the spins of the two –CH<sub>2</sub>Br protons can align, as shown in <link target-id="fig-00002"/>. If both proton spins align with the applied field, the total effective field felt by the neighboring –CH<sub>3</sub> protons is slightly larger than it would be otherwise. Consequently, the applied field necessary to cause resonance is slightly reduced. Alternatively, if one of the –CH<sub>2</sub>Br proton spins aligns with the field and one aligns against the field, there is no effect on the neighboring –CH<sub>3</sub> protons. (This arrangement can occur in two ways, depending on which of the two proton spins aligns which way.) Finally, if both –CH<sub>2</sub>Br proton spins align against the applied field, the effective field felt by the –CH<sub>3</sub> protons is slightly smaller than it would be otherwise, and the applied field needed for resonance is slightly increased.</para>

    <para id="para-00004">Any given molecule has only one of the three possible alignments of –CH<sub>2</sub>Br spins, but in a large collection of molecules, all three spin states are represented in a 1 : 2 : 1 statistical ratio. We therefore find that the neighboring –CH<sub>3</sub> protons come into resonance at three slightly different values of the applied field, and we see a 1 : 2 : 1 triplet in the NMR spectrum. One resonance is a little above where it would be without coupling, one is at the same place it would be without coupling, and the third resonance is a little below where it would be without coupling.</para>
    <para id="para-00005">In the same way that the –CH<sub>3</sub> absorption of bromoethane is split into a triplet, the –CH<sub>2</sub>Br absorption is split into a quartet. The three spins of the neighboring –CH<sub>3</sub> protons can align in four possible combinations: all three with the applied field, two with and one against (three ways), one with and two against (three ways), or all three against. Thus, four peaks are produced for the –CH<sub>2</sub>Br protons in a 1 : 3 : 3 : 1 ratio.</para>
    <para id="para-00006">As a general rule, called the <term id="term-00004"><emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> + 1 rule</term>, protons that have <emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> equivalent neighboring protons show <emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> + 1 peaks in their NMR spectrum. For example, the spectrum of 2-bromopropane in <link target-id="fig-00003"/> shows a <emphasis effect="italics">doublet</emphasis> at 1.71 <emphasis effect="italics">δ</emphasis> and a seven-line multiplet, or <emphasis effect="italics">septet,</emphasis> at 4.28 <emphasis effect="italics">δ</emphasis>. The septet is caused by splitting of the –CHBr– proton signal by six equivalent neighboring protons on the two methyl groups (<emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> = 6 leads to 6 + 1 = 7 peaks). The doublet is due to signal splitting of the six equivalent methyl protons by the single –CHBr– proton (<emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> = 1 leads to 2 peaks). Integration confirms the expected 6 : 1 ratio.</para>

Note that the distance between peaks is the same in both multiplets. Note also that the two outer peaks of the septet are small enough to be nearly missed.</caption>

    <para id="para-00007">The distance between peaks in a multiplet is called the <term id="term-00005">coupling constant</term> and is denoted <emphasis effect="italics">J</emphasis>. Coupling constants are measured in hertz and generally fall in the range 0 to 18 Hz. The exact value of the coupling constant between two neighboring protons depends on the geometry of the molecule, but a typical value for an open-chain alkane is <emphasis effect="italics">J</emphasis> = 6 to 8 Hz. The same coupling constant is shared by both groups of hydrogens whose spins are coupled and is independent of spectrometer field strength. In bromoethane, for instance, the –CH<sub>2</sub>Br protons are coupled to the  –CH<sub>3</sub> protons and appear as a quartet with <emphasis effect="italics">J</emphasis> = 7 Hz. The –CH<sub>3</sub> protons appear as a triplet with the same <emphasis effect="italics">J</emphasis> = 7 Hz coupling constant.</para>
    <para id="para-00008">Because coupling is a reciprocal interaction between two adjacent groups of protons, it’s sometimes possible to tell which multiplets in a complex NMR spectrum are related to each other. If two multiplets have the same coupling constant, they are probably related, and the protons causing those multiplets are therefore adjacent in the molecule.</para>
    <para id="para-00009">The most commonly observed coupling patterns and the relative intensities of lines in their multiplets are listed in <link target-id="table-00001"/>. Note that it’s not possible for a given proton to have five equivalent neighboring protons. (Why not?) A six-line multiplet, or sextet, is therefore found only when a proton has five nonequivalent neighboring protons that coincidentally happen to be coupled with an identical coupling constant <emphasis effect="italics">J</emphasis>.</para>
