    <para id="para-00001">As each functional group is discussed in future chapters, the spectroscopic properties of that group will be described. For the present, we’ll point out some distinguishing features of the hydrocarbon functional groups already studied and briefly preview some other common functional groups. We should also point out, however, that in addition to interpreting absorptions that <emphasis effect="italics">are</emphasis> present in an IR spectrum, it’s also possible to get structural information by noticing which absorptions are <emphasis effect="italics">not</emphasis> present. If the spectrum of a compound has no absorptions at 3300 and 2150 cm<sup>–1</sup>, the compound is not a terminal alkyne; if the spectrum has no absorption near 3400 cm<sup>–1</sup>, the compound is not an alcohol; and so on.</para>

    <title>Alkanes</title>
    <para id="para-00002">The IR spectrum of an alkane is fairly uninformative because no functional groups are present and all absorptions are due to C – H and C – C bonds. Alkane C – H bonds show a strong absorption from 2850 to 2960 cm<sup>–1</sup>, and saturated C –C bonds show a number of bands in the 800 to 1300 cm<sup>–1</sup> range. Since most organic compounds contain saturated alkane-like portions, most organic compounds have these characteristic IR absorptions. The C – H and C – C bands are clearly visible in the three spectra shown previously in <!--<link document="m00141" target-id="fig-00001"/>-->.</para>

    <title>Alkenes</title>
    <para id="para-00003">Alkenes show several characteristic stretching absorptions. Vinylic =C – H bonds absorb from 3020 to 3100 cm<sup>–1</sup>, and alkene C=C bonds usually absorb near 1650 cm<sup>–1</sup>, although in some cases their peaks can be rather small and difficult to see clearly when the alkene is symmetric, or nearly so. Both absorptions are visible in the 1-hexene spectrum in <!--<link document="m00141" target-id="fig-00001"/>-->b.</para>

For example, monosubstituted alkenes such as 1-hexene show strong characteristic bands at 910 and 990 cm<sup>–1</sup>, and 1,1-disubstituted alkenes (R<sub>2</sub>C ═ CH<sub>2</sub>) have an intense band at 890 cm<sup>–1</sup>.</para>

    <title>X-Ray Crystallography</title>
    <para id="para-00027">The various spectroscopic techniques described in this and the next two chapters are enormously important in chemistry and have been fine-tuned to such a degree that the structure of almost any molecule can be found. Nevertheless, wouldn’t it be nice if you could simply look at a molecule and “see” its structure with your eyes?</para>
    <para id="para-00028">Determining the three-dimensional shape of an object around you is easy—you just look at it, let your eyes focus the light rays reflected from the object, and let your brain assemble the data into a recognizable image. If the object is small, you use a microscope and let the microscope lens focus the visible light. Unfortunately, there is a limit to what you can see, even with the best optical microscope. Called the diffraction limit, you can’t see anything smaller than the wavelength of light you are using for the observation. Visible light has wavelengths of several hundred nanometers, but atoms in molecules have dimensions on the order of 0.1 nm. Thus, to see a molecule—whether a small one in the laboratory or a large, complex enzyme with a molecular weight in the tens of thousands—you need wavelengths in the 0.1 nm range, which corresponds to X rays.</para>
    <para id="para-00029">Let’s say that we want to determine the structure and shape of an enzyme or other biological molecule. The technique used is called <emphasis effect="bold">X-ray crystallography</emphasis>. First, the molecule is crystallized (which often turns out to be the most difficult and time-consuming part of the entire process) and a small crystal of 0.4 to 0.5 mm on its longest axis is glued to the end of a glass fiber. The fiber and attached crystal are then mounted in an instrument called an X-ray diffractometer, which consists of a radiation source, a sample positioning and orienting device that can rotate the crystal in any direction, a detector, and a controlling computer.</para>
    <para id="para-00030">Once mounted in the diffractometer, the crystal is irradiated with X rays, usually so-called Cu<emphasis effect="italics">K<sub>α</sub></emphasis> radiation with a wavelength of 0.154 nm. When the X rays strike the enzyme crystal, they interact with electrons in the molecule and are scattered into a diffraction pattern which, when detected and visualized, appears as a series of intense spots against a null background.</para>

    <para id="para-00031">Manipulation of the diffraction pattern to extract three-dimensional molecular data is a complex process, but the final result is an electron-density map of the molecule. Because electrons are largely localized around atoms, any two centers of electron density located within bonding distance of each other are assumed to represent bonded atoms, leading to a recognizable chemical structure. So important is this structural information for biochemistry that an online database of more than 100,000 biological substances has been created. Operated by Rutgers University and funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Protein Data Bank (PDB) is a worldwide repository for processing and distributing three-dimensional structural data for biological macromolecules. We’ll see how to access the PDB in the Chapter 26 <emphasis effect="italics">Chemistry Matters</emphasis>.</para>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <para id="para-00032">Finding the structure of a new molecule, whether a small one synthesized in the laboratory or a large protein found in living organisms, is central to the progression of chemistry and biochemistry. The structure of an organic molecule is usually determined using spectroscopic methods, including mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy. <emphasis effect="bold">Mass spectrometry (MS)</emphasis> tells the molecular weight and formula of a molecule; <emphasis effect="bold">infrared (IR) spectroscopy</emphasis> identifies the functional groups present in the molecule.</para>
    <para id="para-00033">In small-molecule mass spectrometry, molecules are first ionized by collision with a high-energy electron beam. The ions then fragment into smaller pieces, which are magnetically sorted according to their mass-to-charge ratio (<emphasis effect="italics">m</emphasis>/<emphasis effect="italics">z</emphasis>). The ionized sample molecule is called the <emphasis effect="italics">molecular ion, M</emphasis><sup>+</sup>, and measurement of its mass gives the molecular weight of the sample. Structural clues about unknown samples can be obtained by interpreting the fragmentation pattern of the molecular ion. Mass-spectral fragmentations are usually complex, however, and interpretation is often difficult. In biological mass spectrometry, molecules are protonated using either electrospray ionization (ESI) or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), and the protonated molecules are separated by time-of-flight (TOF) mass analysis.</para>
    <para id="para-00034">Infrared spectroscopy involves the interaction of a molecule with <emphasis effect="bold">electromagnetic radiation</emphasis>. When an organic molecule is irradiated with infrared energy, certain <emphasis effect="bold">frequencies</emphasis> are absorbed by the molecule. The frequencies absorbed correspond to the amounts of energy needed to increase the amplitude of specific molecular vibrations such as bond stretching and bending. Since every functional group has a characteristic combination of bonds, every functional group has a characteristic set of infrared absorptions. For example, the terminal alkyne <m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>≡</m:mo><m:mtext>C</m:mtext><m:mo>–</m:mo><m:mtext>H</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> bond absorbs IR radiation of 3300 cm<sup>–1</sup>, and the alkene C=C bond absorbs in the range 1640 to 1680 cm<sup>–1</sup>. By observing which frequencies of infrared radiation are absorbed by a molecule and which are not, it’s possible to determine the functional groups a molecule contains.</para>
