    <para id="para-00001">When thinking about chemical reactivity, chemists usually focus their attention on bonds, the covalent interactions between atoms <emphasis effect="italics">within</emphasis> molecules. Also important, however, particularly in large biomolecules like proteins and nucleic acids, are a variety of interactions <emphasis effect="italics">between</emphasis> molecules that strongly affect molecular properties. Collectively called either <emphasis effect="italics">intermolecular forces, van der Waals forces,</emphasis> or <term id="term-00001">noncovalent interactions</term>, they are of several different types: dipoleâ€“dipole forces, dispersion forces, and hydrogen bonds.</para>
