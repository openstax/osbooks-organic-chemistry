    <para id="para-00002">Pyridine is much like benzene in its <emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis> electron structure. Each of the five <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbons has a <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbital perpendicular to the plane of the ring, and each <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbital contains one <emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis> electron. The nitrogen atom is also <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>2</sup>-hybridized and has one electron in a <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbital, bringing the total to six <emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis> electrons. The nitrogen lone-pair electrons (red in an electrostatic potential map) are in a <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>2</sup> orbital in the plane of the ring and are not part of the aromatic <emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis> system.

In pyrrole, each of the four <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbons contributes one <emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis> electron and the <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>2</sup>-hybridized nitrogen atom contributes the two from its lone pair, which occupies a <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbital (<link target-id="fig-00002"/>).

    <para id="para-00004">Note that nitrogen atoms have different roles depending on the structure of the molecule. The nitrogen atoms in pyridine and pyrimidine are both in double bonds and contribute only one <emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis> electron to the aromatic sextet, just as a carbon atom in benzene does. The nitrogen atom in pyrrole, however, is not in a double bond and contributes two <emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis> electrons (its lone pair) to the aromatic sextet. In imidazole, both kinds of nitrogen are present in the same molecule—a double-bonded “pyridine-like” nitrogen that contributes one <emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis> electron and a “pyrrole-like” nitrogen that contributes two.</para>
    <para id="para-00005">Pyrimidine and imidazole rings are particularly important in biological chemistry. Pyrimidine, for instance, is the parent ring system in cytosine, thymine, and uracil, three of the five heterocyclic amine bases found in nucleic acids. An aromatic imidazole ring is present in histidine, one of the 20 amino acids found in proteins.</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows the structures of Cytosine (in DNA and RNA) Thymine (in DNA) Uracil (in RNA) and Histidine (an amino acid). Cytosine shows a 6-membered ring with a nitrogen nitrogen monohydride and two double bonds. The ring is bonded to an amino group at the first position and double bonded to an oxygen at the third position. Thymine shows a 6-membered ring with two nitrogen atoms and one double bond. Each nitrogen is bonded to a hydrogen. The ring is double bonded to an oxygen atom at the first position and at the third position. A methyl group is bonded to the carbon at the sixth position. Uracil is similar to thymine but the methyl group is absent. Histidine shows a 5-membered ring with a nitrogen nitrogen monohydride and two double bonds. The ring is bonded to a methylene group bonded to a carbon that is wedge bonded to a hydrogen dash bonded to an ammonium group and single bonded to a carboxylate ion.">
