    <para>Alkyne nomenclature follows the general rules for hydrocarbons discussed in <link document="m00035">Section 3.4</link> and <link document="m00065">Section 7.3</link>. The suffix <emphasis effect="italics">-yne</emphasis> is used, and the position of the triple bond is indicated by giving the number of the first alkyne carbon in the chain. Numbering the main chain begins at the end nearer the triple bond so that the triple bond receives as low a number as possible.</para>

    <para>Compounds with more than one triple bond are called diynes, triynes, and so forth; compounds containing both double and triple bonds are called enynes (not ynenes). Numbering of an enyne chain starts from the end nearer the first multiple bond, whether double or triple. When there is a choice in numbering, double bonds receive lower numbers than triple bonds. For example:</para>

    <para>As with alkyl and alkenyl substituents derived from alkanes and alkenes, respectively, alkynyl groups are also possible.</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows three structural formulas. The first formula (Butyl an alkyl group) shows a methyl group bonded to three consecutive methylene groups; the last methylene group shows an open bond intersected by a wavy pink line. The second formula (1-Butenyl a vinylic group; New: But-1-enyl) shows a methyl group bonded to a methylene group bonded to a methine group that is double bonded to a methine group having an open bond intersected by a pink wavy line. the third formula (1-Butynyl an alkynyl group; New: But-1-ynyl) shows a methyl group bonded to a methylene group bonded to a carbon triple bonded to another carbon whose open bond is intersected by a pink wavy line.">
