    <para id="para-00003">Imine formation and enamine formation seem different because one leads to a product with a <m:math><m:mrow><m:mtext>C&#x2550;N</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> bond and the other leads to a product with a <m:math><m:mrow><m:mtext>C&#x2550;C</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> bond.

    <para id="para-00004">Imines are formed in a reversible, acid-catalyzed process (<link target-id="fig-00003"/>) that begins with nucleophilic addition of the primary amine to the carbonyl group, followed by transfer of a proton from nitrogen to oxygen to yield a neutral amino alcohol, or <term id="term-00004">carbinolamine</term>. Protonation of the carbinolamine oxygen by an acid catalyst then converts the –OH into a better leaving group (–OH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>), and E1-like loss of water produces an iminium ion. Loss of a proton from nitrogen gives the final product and regenerates the acid catalyst.</para>

    <para id="para-00005">Imine formation with such reagents as hydroxylamine and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine is sometimes useful because the products of these reactions—<emphasis effect="italics">oximes</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones (2,4-DNPs),</emphasis> respectively—are often crystalline and easy to handle.

    <para id="para-00006">Reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a secondary amine, R<sub>2</sub>NH, rather than a primary amine yields an enamine. As shown in <link target-id="fig-00005"/>, the process is identical to imine formation up to the iminium ion stage, but at this point there is no proton on nitrogen that can be lost to form a neutral imine product. Instead, a proton is lost from the <emphasis effect="italics">neighboring</emphasis> carbon (the <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis> carbon), yielding an enamine.</para>

    <para id="para-00007">Imine and enamine formation are slow at both high pH and low pH but reach a maximum rate at a weakly acidic pH around 4 to 5. For example, the profile of pH versus rate shown in <link target-id="fig-00006"/> for the reaction between acetone and hydroxylamine, NH<sub>2</sub>OH, indicates that the maximum reaction rate occurs at pH 4.5.</para>
    <para id="para-00008">We can explain the observed pH dependence of imine formation by looking at the individual steps in the mechanism. As indicated in <link target-id="fig-00005"/>, an acid catalyst is required in step 3 to protonate the intermediate carbinolamine, thereby converting the –OH into a better leaving group. Thus, reaction will be slow if not enough acid is present (that is, at high pH). On the other hand, if too much acid is present (low pH), the basic amine nucleophile is completely protonated, so the initial nucleophilic addition step can’t occur.</para>
