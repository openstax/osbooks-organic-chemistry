    <para id="para-00001">The same kind of orbital hybridization that accounts for the methane structure also accounts for the bonding together of carbon atoms into chains and rings to make possible many millions of organic compounds. Ethane, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, is the simplest molecule containing a carbon–carbon bond.</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows the Lewis structure, Kekulé structure, and structural formula of ethane. The Lewis structure shows two carbon atoms sharing a pair of electrons between them; each carbon shows three pairs of electrons and three hydrogens. The Kekulé structure shows two carbons single bonded to each other; each carbon is bonded to three hydrogens. The structural formula shows two methyl groups bonded to each other.">

    <para id="para-00002">We can picture the ethane molecule by imagining that the two carbon atoms bond to each other by head-on sigma (<emphasis effect="italics">σ</emphasis>) overlap of an <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup> hybrid orbital from each (<link target-id="fig-00002"/>). The remaining three <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals on each carbon overlap with the 1<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> orbitals of three hydrogens to form the six C–H bonds. The C–H bonds in ethane are similar to those in methane, although a bit weaker: 421 kJ/mol (101 kcal/mol) for ethane versus 439 kJ/mol for methane. The C–C bond is 153 pm in length and has a strength of 377 kJ/mol (90 kcal/mol). All the bond angles of ethane are near, although not exactly at, the tetrahedral value of 109.5°.</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows the formation of sp3-sp3 sigma bond in ethane. The structural formula and ball-and-stick models of ethane are also shown. Two sp3 carbons hybridize to form sp3-sp3 sigma bond. Each sp3 carbon shows a tetrahedral orbital with the carbon at the center and a dot each in the four lobes. The structural formula shows two carbon atoms single bonded to each other. Each carbon is dash bonded to a hydrogen single bonded to a hydrogen and wedge bonded to a hydrogen. The angle between the C-C bond and the top hydrogen of the right carbon is 111.2 degrees. The length of C-C bond is 153 pm. The ball-and-stick model shows gray balls (carbons) and white balls (hydrogens)">
