<title>Acid-Catalyzed Epoxide Opening</title>
<para id="para-00001">Epoxides are cleaved by treatment with acid just as other ethers are, but under much milder conditions because of ring strain. As we saw in <link document="m00095"/>, dilute aqueous acid at room temperature is sufficient for facilitating the hydrolysis of epoxides to give 1,2-diols, also called <emphasis effect="italics">vicinal glycols.</emphasis> (The word <emphasis effect="italics">vicinal</emphasis> means “adjacent,” and a <emphasis effect="italics">glycol</emphasis> is a diol.) The epoxide cleavage takes place by S<sub>N</sub>2-like backside attack of a nucleophile on the protonated epoxide, giving a trans-1,2-diol as product.</para>

<media alt="An illustration shows 2 chemical reactions. The first reaction shows 1 2-Epoxycyclohexane in the presence of a hydronium ion yielding two intermediate compounds where the first one in the presence of water will yield the second intermediate.

The second intermediate shows a cyclohexane with C1 dash bonded to a hydrogen and wedge bonded to a hydroxyl group (O is pink and H is blue).

The cyclohexene shows a single double bond and is bonded to two hydrogens. The structure of the intermediate shows a cyclohexene ring with C1 and C2 dash bonded to a hydrogen atom each.

<para id="para-00003">The regiochemistry of acid-catalyzed ring-opening depends on the epoxide’s structure, and a mixture of products is often formed. When both epoxide carbon atoms are either primary or secondary, attack of the nucleophile occurs primarily at the less highly substituted site: an S<sub>N</sub>2-like result. When one of the epoxide carbon atoms is tertiary, however, nucleophilic attack occurs primarily at the <emphasis effect="italics">more</emphasis> highly substituted site—an S<sub>N</sub>1-like result. Thus, 1,2-epoxypropane reacts with HCl to give primarily 1-chloro-2-propanol, but 2-methyl-1,2-epoxypropane gives 2-chloro-2-methyl-1- propanol as the major product.</para>

<para id="para-00004">The mechanisms of these acid-catalyzed epoxide openings are more complex than they initially appear. They seem to be neither purely S<sub>N</sub>1 nor S<sub>N</sub>2 but instead to be midway between the two extremes and to have characteristics of both. For instance, take the reaction of 1,2-epoxy-1-methylcyclohexane with HBr, shown in <link target-id="fig-00004"/>. The reaction yields only a single stereoisomer of 2-bromo-2-methylcyclohexanol in which the –Br and –OH groups are trans, an S<sub>N</sub>2-like result caused by backside displacement of the epoxide oxygen. But the fact that Br<sup>–</sup> attacks the more hindered tertiary side of the epoxide rather than the less hindered secondary side is an S<sub>N</sub>1-like result in which the more stable, tertiary carbocation is involved.</para>
<para id="para-00005">Evidently, the transition state for acid-catalyzed epoxide opening has an S<sub>N</sub>2-like geometry but also has a high degree of S<sub>N</sub>1-like carbocationic character. Because the positive charge in the protonated epoxide is shared by the more highly substituted carbon atom, backside attack of Br<sup>–</sup> occurs at the more highly substituted site.</para>
