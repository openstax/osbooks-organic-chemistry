    <para id="para-00001">Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.</para>
    <para id="para-00002">Are you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand; left-handed people write in a “funny” way. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren’t identical; rather, they’re <emphasis effect="italics">mirror images</emphasis>. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.</para>

    <para id="para-00003">Handedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup>-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies—amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more—have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.</para>
