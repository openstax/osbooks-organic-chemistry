<para id="para-00001">This chapter finishes the coverage of functional groups with C–O and C–S single bonds that was begun in the chapter on <link document="m00199">Alcohols and Phenols</link>. We’ll focus primarily on ethers and take only a brief look at thiols and sulfides before going on to an extensive coverage of compounds with <m:math><m:mrow><m:mtext>C=O</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> double bonds in Chapters 19 through 23.</para>
<para id="para-00002"><term id="term-00001">Ethers (R–O–R′)</term>, like the alcohols we saw in the preceding chapter, are organic derivatives of water, but they have two organic groups bonded to the same oxygen atom rather than one. The organic groups might be alkyl, aryl, or vinylic, and the oxygen atom might be in an open chain or a ring.</para>
<para id="para-00003">Perhaps the most well-known ether is diethyl ether, which has a long history of medicinal use as an anesthetic and industrial use as a solvent. Other useful ethers include anisole, a pleasant-smelling aromatic ether used in perfumery, and tetrahydrofuran (THF), a cyclic ether often used as a solvent.</para>

<media alt="An illustration shows the ball-and-stick model and corresponding structures of “Diethyl ether ” “Anisole (methyl phenyl ether)” and “Tetrahydrofuran.” The ball-and-stick model of “Diethyl ether” shows 4 gray balls representing carbon atoms 10 white balls representing hydrogen atoms and 1 red ball representing oxygen atom. The chemical structure of “Diethyl ether” shows an oxygen atom bonded to an ethyl group on either sides. The ball-and-stick model of “Anisole” shows 7 gray balls representing carbon atoms 8 white balls representing hydrogen atoms and 1 red ball representing oxygen atom. The structure shows a benzene ring bonded to an oxygen atom bonded to a methyl group. The ball-and-stick model of “Tetrahydrofuran” shows 4 gray balls representing carbon atoms 8 white balls representing hydrogen atoms and 1 red ball representing oxygen atom. The corresponding structure shows a cyclopentane with an oxygen atom at its tip. The oxygen atom is highlighted in all the three structures.">

<para id="para-00004"><term id="term-00002">Thiols</term> (R–S–H) and sulfides (R–S–R′) are sulfur analogs of alcohols and ethers, respectively. Both functional groups are found in various biomolecules, although not as commonly as their oxygen-containing relatives.</para>
