If the number of carbon atoms in the ring is equal to or greater than the number in the substituent, the compound is named as an alkyl-substituted cycloalkane. If the number of carbon atoms in the largest substituent is greater than the number in the ring, the compound is named as a cycloalkyl-substituted alkane. For example:</para>

The structure of 1 3-Dimethylcyclohexane shows a cyclohexane bonded to methyl groups at two alternate positions; the numbering begins from the tip of the ring as “1” and follows the clockwise path till position “6” on the left side of the ring. The structure of 1 5-Dimethylcyclohexane shows the same structure except that the numbering starts from the upper tip of the ring and follows an anticlockwise path till position “6” on the right side of the ring.">
