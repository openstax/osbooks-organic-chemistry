    <para id="para-00001">The outbreak of World War I provided a stimulus for the industrial preparation of large amounts of synthetic phenol, which was needed as a raw material to manufacture the explosive, picric acid (2,4,6-trinitrophenol). Today, approximately 132 million tons of phenol is manufactured worldwide each year for use in such products as Bakelite resin and adhesives for binding plywood.</para>
    <para id="para-00002">Phenol was manufactured for many years by the Dow process, in which chlorobenzene reacts with NaOH at high temperature and pressure <emphasis effect="bold">(<link document="m00195">Section 16.7</link>)</emphasis>. Now, however, an alternative synthesis uses isopropylbenzene, commonly called <emphasis effect="italics">cumene</emphasis>. Cumene reacts with air at high temperature by benzylic oxidation through a radical mechanism to form cumene hydroperoxide, which is converted into phenol and acetone by treatment with acid. This is a particularly efficient process because two valuable chemicals are prepared at the same time.</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows the 2 steps involved in the synthesis of phenol. Cumene (isopropylbenzene) reacts with pink oxygen in the presence of heat to form cumene hydroperoxide that reacts with pink hydronium ion to form a phenol and acetone. Cumene shows a benzene bonded to a carbon bonded to two methyl groups and also bonded to a blue hydrogen. Cumene hydroperoxide shows a benzene bonded to a carbon bonded to two methyl groups and also bonded to two pink oxygens bonded to a blue hydrogen. Phenol is shown as a benzene bonded to a pink hydroxyl group. Acetone is shown as a centrally placed carbonyl group having pink oxygen bonded to two methyl groups on either sides.">

    <para id="para-00003">As shown in <link target-id="fig-00002"/>, the reaction occurs by protonation of oxygen followed by shift of the phenyl group from carbon to oxygen with simultaneous loss of water. Replacement of the water then yields an intermediate called a <emphasis effect="italics">hemiacetal</emphasis>—a compound that contains one  – OR group and one  – OH group bonded to the same carbon atom—which breaks down to phenol and acetone.</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows steps involved in the acid catalysis of cumene hydroperoxide and the associated reversible structures. The structure of cumene hydroperoxide shows a benzene bonded to a carbon on the upper left corner of ring which is attached to two methyl groups at the top the carbon is bonded to a pink oxygen on the left which is bonded to a green oxygen having two pairs of electrons bonded to a green hydrogen. Step “1” reads “protonation of the hydroperoxy group on the terminal oxygen atom gives an oxonium ion...” The reversible reaction step “1” occurs in presence of green hydronium ion. The oxonium ion shows a benzene bonded to a carbon on the upper left corner of ring attached to two methyl groups at the top the carbon is bonded to a pink oxygen on the left which is bonded to a green oxygen cation having two pairs of electrons bonded to two green hydrogens. Step “2” reads “..which undergoes rearrangement by migration of the phenyl ring from carbon to oxygen expelling water as the leaving group and giving a carbocation.” The carbocation shows a benzene bonded to a pink oxygen bonded on the upper right corner of ring which is attached to a carbon cation bonded to two methyl groups; a green oxygen having two pairs of electrons bonded to a green hydrogen molecule; a pink arrow points from green oxygen to carbon cation. Step “3” reads “nucleophilic addition of water to the carbocation yields another oxonium ion...”; the reversible reaction step “3” points to a benzene bonded pink oxygen bonded on the upper right corner of ring which is attached to a carbon bonded to two methyl groups; at the bottom carbon is bonded to a green oxygen cation bonded to two green hydrogen molecules. Step “4” reads”...which rearranges by a proton shift from one oxygen to another.” The reversible reaction step “4” points to a benzene bonded to pink oxygen cation on the upper right corner of ring the oxygen cation is bonded to a green hydrogen at the top; the carbon is bonded to two methyl groups; the carbon is bonded to a green oxygen bonded to green hydrogen at the bottom; a green oxygen with two pairs of electrons attached to a hydrogen molecule is shown; a pink arrow points from the electrons to hydrogen of O-H bond; another arrow points from O-H bond to C-O bond; the third arrow points from C-oxygen cation to oxygen cation. Step “5” reads “elimination of phenol gives acetone as co-product and regenerates the acid catalyst.” The step “5” of reversible reaction shows loss of green hydronium ion points to phenol having benzene bonded to a pink oxygen attached to green hydrogen. The structure of centrally located carbonyl group with green oxygen the carbon is bonded to two methyl groups.">

    <para id="para-00004">In addition to its use in making resins and adhesives, phenol is also the starting material for the synthesis of chlorinated phenols and the food preservatives BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) and BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole). Pentachlorophenol, a widely used wood preservative, is prepared by reaction of phenol with excess Cl<sub>2</sub>. The herbicide 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) is prepared from 2,4-dichlorophenol, and the hospital antiseptic agent hexachlorophene is prepared from 2,4,5-trichlorophenol.</para>
