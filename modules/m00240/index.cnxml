    <para id="para-00001">The addition of a nucleophile to a polar C=O bond is the key step in three of the four major carbonyl-group reactions. We saw in the chapter on <link document="m00211">Aldehydes and Ketones: Nucleophilic Addition Reactions</link> that when a nucleophile adds to an aldehyde or ketone, the initially formed tetrahedral intermediate can be protonated to yield an alcohol. When a nucleophile adds to a carboxylic acid derivative, however, a different reaction path is taken. The initially formed tetrahedral intermediate eliminates one of the two substituents originally bonded to the carbonyl carbon, leading to a net <term id="term-00001">nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction</term> (<link target-id="fig-00001"/>).</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows two reactions. The first reaction is labeled ‘(a) Aldehyde or ketone: nucleophilic addition.’ A carbonyl compound reacts with blue Nu anion that shows two electrons to yield an Alkoxide ion intermediate that reacts with hydronium ion (highlighted in pink) to yield an alcohol. The carbonyl compound shows a central carbonyl group bonded to an R and R’. An arrow from the electrons of Nu points to the carbon. An arrow from the carbonyl bond points to oxygen that shows four electrons. The Alkoxide ion intermediate shows a carbon dash bonded to R wedge bonded to R’ and single bonded to blue Nu and oxygen anion that shows six electrons. The alcohol shows a carbon dash bonded to R wedge bonded to R’ and single bonded to Nu and pink hydroxyl group. The oxygen atoms are highlighted in pink. The second reaction is labeled ‘(b) Carboxylic acid derivative: nucleophilic acyl substitution.’ A carbonyl compound reacts with blue Nu anion that shows two electrons to yield an Alkoxide ion intermediate that reacts to yield a new carbonyl compound and Y anion. The carbonyl compound shows a central carbonyl group bonded to an R and green Y. An arrow from the electrons of blue Nu points to the carbon. An arrow from the carbonyl bond points to oxygen that shows four electrons.

    <para id="para-00002">The difference in behavior between aldehydes/ketones and carboxylic acid derivatives is a consequence of structure. Carboxylic acid derivatives have an acyl carbon bonded to a group  – Y that can act as a leaving group, often as a stable anion. As soon as the tetrahedral intermediate is formed, the leaving group is expelled to generate a new carbonyl compound. Aldehydes and ketones, however, have no such leaving group, however, and therefore don’t undergo substitution.</para>

The third structure a ketone shows a carbonyl group bonded to R and blue R’ (not a leaving group). The oxygen atoms are highlighted in pink.">

    <para id="para-00003">The net effect of the addition/elimination sequence is a substitution of the nucleophile for the  – Y group that was originally bonded to the acyl carbon. Thus, the overall reaction is superficially similar to the kind of nucleophilic substitution that occurs during an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction <emphasis effect="bold">(<link document="m00124">Section 11.3</link>)</emphasis>, but the mechanisms of the two reactions are completely different. An S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction occurs in a single step by backside displacement of the leaving group, while a nucleophilic acyl substitution takes place in two steps and involves a tetrahedral intermediate.</para>

    <title>Relative Reactivity of Carboxylic Acid Derivatives</title>
    <para id="para-00005">Both the initial addition step and the subsequent elimination step can affect the overall rate of a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction, but the addition is usually the rate-limiting step. Thus, any factor that makes the carbonyl group more reactive toward nucleophiles favors the substitution process.</para>
    <para id="para-00006">Steric and electronic factors are both important in determining reactivity. Sterically, we find within a series of similar acid derivatives that unhindered, accessible carbonyl groups react with nucleophiles more readily than do sterically hindered carbonyl groups.

    <para id="para-00007">Electronically, we find that strongly polarized acyl compounds react more readily than less polar ones. Thus, acid chlorides are the most reactive because the electronegative chlorine atom withdraws electrons from the carbonyl carbon, whereas amides are the least reactive. Although subtle, electrostatic potential maps of various carboxylic acid derivatives indicate these differences by the relative blueness on the C=O carbons. Acyl phosphates are hard to place on this scale because they are not often used in the laboratory, but in biological systems they appear to be somewhat more reactive than thioesters.</para>

    <para id="para-00008">The way in which various substituents affect the polarization of a carbonyl group is similar to the way they affect the reactivity of an aromatic ring toward electrophilic substitution <emphasis effect="bold">(<link document="m00192">Section 16.4</link>)</emphasis>. A chlorine substituent, for example, inductively withdraws electrons from an acyl group in the same way that it withdraws electrons from and thus deactivates an aromatic ring. Similarly, amino, methoxyl, and methylthio substituents donate electrons to acyl groups by resonance in the same way that they donate electrons to, and thus activate, aromatic rings.</para>
    <para id="para-00009">As a consequence of these reactivity differences, it’s usually possible to convert a more reactive acid derivative into a less reactive one. Acid chlorides, for instance, can be directly converted into anhydrides, thioesters, esters, and amides, but amides can’t be directly converted into esters, thioesters, anhydrides, or acid chlorides. Remembering the reactivity order is therefore a way to keep track of a large number of reactions (<link target-id="fig-00005"/>). Another consequence, as noted previously, is that only acyl phosphates, thioesters, esters, and amides are commonly found in nature. Acid halides and acid anhydrides react so rapidly with water that they can’t exist for long in living organisms.</para>
