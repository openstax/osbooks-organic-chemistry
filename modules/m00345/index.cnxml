<para id="para-00001">A <term id="term-00001">cycloaddition reaction</term> is one in which two unsaturated molecules add to one another to yield a cyclic product. As with electrocyclic reactions, cycloadditions are governed by the orbital symmetry of the reactants. Symmetry-allowed processes often take place readily, but symmetry-disallowed processes take place with difficulty, if at all, and then only by nonconcerted pathways. Let’s look at two examples to see how they differ.</para>
<para id="para-00002">As we saw in <link document="m00174"/>, the Diels–Alder cycloaddition reaction is a pericyclic process that takes place between a diene (four <emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis> electrons) and a dienophile (two <emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis> electrons) to yield a cyclohexene product. Many thousands of Diels–Alder reactions are known. They often take place easily at room temperature or slightly above, and they are stereospecific with respect to substituents. For example, room-temperature reaction between 1,3-butadiene and diethyl maleate (cis) exclusively yields the cis-disubstituted cyclohexene product. A similar reaction between 1,3-butadiene and diethyl fumarate (trans) exclusively yields the trans-disubstituted product.</para>

<para id="para-00003">In contrast to the [4 + 2]-<emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis>-electron Diels–Alder reaction, the [2 + 2]-<emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis>-electron cycloaddition between two alkenes does not occur thermally. The [2 + 2] cycloaddition takes place only on irradiation, yielding cyclobutane products.</para>

<para id="para-00004">For a successful cycloaddition, the terminal <emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis> lobes of the two reactants must have the correct symmetry for bonding to occur. This can happen in either of two ways, called <emphasis effect="italics">suprafacial</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">antarafacial</emphasis>. <term id="term-00002">Suprafacial</term> cycloadditions take place when a bonding interaction occurs between lobes on the same face of one reactant and lobes on the same face of the other reactant. <term id="term-00003">Antarafacial</term> cycloadditions take place when a bonding interaction occurs between lobes on the same face of one reactant and lobes on opposite faces of the other reactant (<link target-id="fig-00003"/>).</para>
<figure class="scaled-down" id="fig-00003">
<media alt="Orbital structures for suprafacial and antarafacial cycloaddition. Suprafacial occurs when lobes on each face match sign. Antarafacial (with twist) occurs when like there is a lobe mismatch.">

<caption><emphasis effect="bold">(a) Suprafacial cycloaddition occurs when there is bonding between lobes on the same face of one reactant and lobes on the same face of the other reactant. (b) Antarafacial cycloaddition occurs when there is bonding between lobes on the same face of one reactant and lobes on opposite faces of the other, which requires a twist in one <emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis> system</emphasis>.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="para-00005">Note that both suprafacial and antarafacial cycloadditions are symmetry-allowed. Geometric constraints often make antarafacial reactions difficult, however, because there must be a twisting of the <emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis> orbital system in one of the reactants. Thus, suprafacial cycloadditions are much more common for small <emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis> systems.</para>
