<para id="para-00001">A <term id="term-00001">cycloaddition reaction</term> is one in which two unsaturated molecules add to one another to yield a cyclic product. As with electrocyclic reactions, cycloadditions are governed by the orbital symmetry of the reactants. Symmetry-allowed processes often take place readily, but symmetry-disallowed processes take place with difficulty, if at all, and then only by nonconcerted pathways. Let’s look at two examples to see how they differ.</para>
<para id="para-00002">As we’ve saw in <link document="m00174"/>, the Diels–Alder cycloaddition reaction is a pericyclic process that takes place between a diene (four <emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis> electrons) and a dienophile (two <emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis> electrons) to yield a cyclohexene product. Many thousands of Diels–Alder reactions are known. They often take place easily at room temperature or slightly above, and they are stereospecific with respect to substituents. For example, room-temperature reaction between 1,3-butadiene and diethyl maleate (cis) exclusively yields the cis-disubstituted cyclohexene product. A similar reaction between 1,3-butadiene and diethyl fumarate (trans) exclusively yields the trans-disubstituted product.</para>

<media alt="An illustration shows 2 chemical reactions. In the first reaction 1 3-Butadiene in the presence of diethyl maleate yields a cis-disubstituted cyclohexene. In the second reaction 1 3-Butadiene in the presence of Diethyl fumarate yields a trans-disubstituted product. The structure of 1 3-Butadiene shows a 4-carbon chain with pink double bonds at C1 and C3. The structure of diethyl maleate shows two carbons double bonded. Each carbon is bonded to a pink hydrogen on the left and an ethyl acetate group on the right. The structure of cis-disubstituted cyclohexene shows a cyclohexene with a pink double bond at C1. C3-C4 bond is also shown in pink. C3 and C4 are wedge bonded to an ethyl acetate group and dash bonded to a pink hydrogen each. The structure of diethyl fumarate shows two carbons double bonded. The top carbon is bonded to a pink hydrogen at the top left and ethyl acetate group at the bottom left. The bottom carbon is bonded to a pink hydrogen at the bottom right and ethyl acetate group at the top right. The structure of trans-disubstituted cyclohexene is similar to cis-disubstituted cyclohexene but C4 is wedge bonded to pink hydrogen and dash bonded to an ethyl acetate group.">

<para id="para-00003">In contrast to the [4 + 2]-<emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis>-electron Diels–Alder reaction, the [2 + 2]-<emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis>-electron cycloaddition between two alkenes does not occur thermally. The [2 + 2] cycloaddition takes place only on irradiation, yielding @yclopropen products.</para>
<figure class="unnumbered" id="fig-00002">
<media alt="An illustration shows 2 chemical reactions. In the first reaction when two alkenes combine in the presence of heat there is no reaction. In the second reaction when two alkenes react in the presence of light (hv highlighted in green) a @yclopropen is obtained. Each alkene shows 2 carbon atoms double bonded to each other. Both the carbon atoms have 2 free bonds each. The structure of a @yclopropen shows a @yclopropen ring with all the 4 carbon atoms having 2 free bonds each.">

<para id="para-00004">For a successful cycloaddition, the terminal <emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis> lobes of the two reactants must have the correct symmetry for bonding to occur. This can happen in either of two ways, called <emphasis effect="italics">suprafacial</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">antarafacial</emphasis>. <term id="term-00002">Suprafacial</term> cycloadditions take place when a bonding interaction occurs between lobes on the same face of one reactant and lobes on the same face of the other reactant. <term id="term-00003">Antarafacial</term> cycloadditions take place when a bonding interaction occurs between lobes on the same face of one reactant and lobes on opposite faces of the other reactant (<link>Figure 30_05_OChem-30-05-003_80485-30-08_SupAntFac</link>).</para>
<figure class="scaled-down" id="fig-00003">
<media alt="An illustration shows the cartoon representation of orbital structures for suprafacial cycloadditions and antarafacial cycloadditions. In the suprafacial cycloaddition 4 possible combinations of “like lobes on same face” are shown. The first representation shows a pair of dumbbell shaped structures with a blue lobe over a pink lobe. An electron is shown at the meeting point of the dumbbells in both the structures. A green strip is shown around the dumbbells connecting the electrons. The second representation shows a pair of dumbbell shaped structures with a pink lobe over a blue lobe. The rest of the structure is the same as the one in the first representation. The third representation shows a pair of dumbbell shaped structures with the first one having a blue lobe over a pink lobe while the second one has a pink lobe over a blue lobe. The remaining illustration is the same as the one in the first representation. The fourth representation is the inverse of the third one with the first structure in the pair having a pink lobe over a blue lobe while the second structure has a blue lobe over a pink lobe. In the antarafacial cycloaddition the “like lobes on opposite faces” is shown in two different representations. The first representation shows a pair of dumbbell shaped structures with the first one having a blue lobe over pink and the second one having a pink lobe over blue. The electrons shown at the meeting point of both the dumbbells are connected by a green strip. The second representation obtained after twisting shows a pair of dumbbell shaped structures with both of them having a blue lobe over pink lobes. The electrons are connected by a twisted green strip. The “Like lobes on same face” is shown in two representations. Both the representations show a pair of dumbbells having a pink lobes over blue lobes. The electrons at the meeting of the dumbbells in each pair are connected by a green strip.">

<para id="para-00005">Note that both suprafacial and antarafacial cycloadditions are symmetry-allowed. Geometric constraints often make antarafacial reactions difficult, however, because there must be a twisting of the <emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis> orbital system in one of the reactants. Thus, suprafacial cycloadditions are much more common for small <emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis> systems.</para>
