    <para id="para-00001">We said at the beginning of this chapter that two kinds of reactions can take place when a nucleophile/Lewis base reacts with an alkyl halide. The nucleophile can either substitute for the halide by reaction at carbon or can cause elimination of HX by reaction at a neighboring hydrogen:</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows a substitution reaction and elimination reaction of a bromoalkane with a hydroxyl group. Substitution yields an alcohol and bromide ion. Elimination yields an alkene water and bromide ion. The bromoalkane shows two carbons single bonded. The first carbon is single bonded to hydrogen and shows a free dash bond and wedge bond. The second carbon is single bonded to bromine and shows a free dash bond and wedge bond. The alcohol is similar but the bromine is replaced by hydroxyl group. The alkene shows two carbons double bonded. Each carbon shows two free bonds.">

    <para id="para-00002">Elimination reactions are more complex than substitution reactions for several reasons. One is the problem of regiochemistry. What product results by loss of HX from an unsymmetrical halide? In fact, elimination reactions almost always give mixtures of alkene products, and the best we can usually do is to predict which will be the major product.</para>
    <para id="para-00003">According to <term id="term-00001">Zaitsev’s rule</term>, formulated in 1875 by the Russian chemist Alexander Zaitsev, base-induced elimination reactions generally (although not always) give the more stable alkene product—that is, the alkene with more alkyl substituents on the double-bond carbons. In the following two cases, for example, the more highly substituted alkene product predominates.</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows two reactions. In the first reaction 2-Bromobutane reacts in the presence of sodium ethoxide and ethanol to yield 2-Butene (81%) and 1-Butene (19%). In the second reaction 2-Bromo-2-methylbutane reacts in the presence of sodium ethoxide and ethanol to yield 2-Methyl-2-butene (70%) and 2-Methyl-1-butene (30%). 2-Bromobutane shows a butane with a bromine bonded to C2. 2-Butene shows two methine groups double bonded. Each methine is bonded to a methyl group. 1-Butene shows an ethyl group bonded to a methine group double bonded to a methylene group. 2-Bromo-2-methylbutane shows a butane with a bromine and methyl group bonded to C2. 2-Methyl-2-butene shows a methyl group bonded to a methine group that is double bonded to a carbon bonded to two methyl groups. 2-Methyl-1-butene shows an ethyl group bonded to a carbon single bonded to a methyl group and double bonded to a methylene group.">

    <para id="para-00006">Another factor that complicates a study of elimination reactions is that they can take place by different mechanisms, just as substitutions can. We’ll consider three of the most common mechanisms—the E1, E2, and E1cB reactions—which differ in the timing of C – H and C – X bond-breaking.</para>
    <para id="para-00007">In the E1 reaction, the C – X bond breaks first to give a carbocation intermediate, which undergoes subsequent base abstraction of H<sup>+</sup> to yield the alkene. In the E2 reaction, base-induced C – H bond cleavage is simultaneous with C – X bond cleavage, giving the alkene in a single step. In the E1cB reaction (cB for “<emphasis effect="italics">conjugate base</emphasis>”), base abstraction of the proton occurs first, giving a carbanion (R<emphasis effect="bold">:</emphasis><sup>–</sup>) intermediate. This anion, the conjugate base of the reactant “acid,” then undergoes loss of X<sup>–</sup> in a subsequent step to give the alkene. All three mechanisms occur frequently in the laboratory, but the E1cB mechanism predominates in biological pathways.</para>
