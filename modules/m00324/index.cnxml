<para id="para-00001">Once the structure of a peptide is known, its synthesis can be undertaken—perhaps to obtain a larger amount for biological evaluation. A simple amide might be formed by treating an amine and a carboxylic acid with a carbodiimide (either DCC or EDC; <link document="m00241"/>), but peptide synthesis is a more difficult problem because many different amide bonds must be formed in a specific order, rather than at random.</para>
<para id="para-00002">The solution to the specificity problem is protection (<link document="m00207"/>). If we want to couple alanine with leucine to synthesize Ala-Leu, for instance, we could protect the –NH<sub>2</sub> group of alanine and the –CO<sub>2</sub>H group of leucine to shield them from reacting, then form the desired Ala-Leu amide bond by reaction with EDC or DCC, and then remove the protecting groups.</para>

<para id="para-00003">A number of different amino- and carboxyl-protecting groups have been devised, but only a few are used in peptide synthesis. Carboxyl groups are often protected simply by converting them into methyl or benzyl esters. Both groups are easily introduced by standard methods of ester formation (<link document="m00244"/>) and are easily removed by mild hydrolysis with aqueous NaOH. Benzyl esters can also be cleaved by catalytic <emphasis effect="italics">hydrogenolysis</emphasis> of the weak benzylic C–O bond (<m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mrow><m:mtext>RCO</m:mtext></m:mrow><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msub><m:msub><m:mrow><m:mtext>–CH</m:mtext></m:mrow><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msub><m:mtext>Ph</m:mtext><m:mo>+</m:mo><m:msub><m:mtext>H</m:mtext><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msub><m:mo>→</m:mo><m:msub><m:mrow><m:mtext>RCO</m:mtext></m:mrow><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msub><m:mtext>H</m:mtext><m:mo>+</m:mo><m:msub><m:mrow><m:mtext>PhCH</m:mtext></m:mrow><m:mn>3</m:mn></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math>).</para>

<para id="para-00004">Amino groups are sometimes protected as their <emphasis effect="italics">tert</emphasis>-butyloxycarbonyl amide (Boc) or, more commonly, as their fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl amide (Fmoc). The Boc protecting group is introduced by reaction of the amino acid with di-<emphasis effect="italics">tert</emphasis>-butyl dicarbonate in a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction and is removed by brief treatment with a strong acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, CF<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H. The Fmoc protecting group is introduced by reaction with fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chloride and is removed by treatment with a 20% solution of the amine piperidine in dimethylformamide as solvent.</para>

<para id="para-00005">Thus, five steps are needed to synthesize a dipeptide such as Ala-Leu:</para>

<para id="para-00006">These steps can be repeated to add one amino acid at a time to the growing chain or to link two peptide chains together. Many remarkable achievements in peptide synthesis have been reported, including a complete synthesis of human insulin. Insulin is composed of two chains totaling 51 amino acids linked by two disulfide bridges. The three-dimensional structure of insulin, shown previously, was determined by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin, a British chemist who received the 1964 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her work on this and other complex biological molecules.</para>
