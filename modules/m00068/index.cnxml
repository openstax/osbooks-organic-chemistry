    <para>Although the cis&#8211;trans interconversion of alkene isomers does not occur spontaneously, it can often be made to happen by treating the alkene with a strong acid catalyst. If we interconvert <emphasis effect="italics">cis</emphasis>-2-butene with <emphasis effect="italics">trans</emphasis>-2-butene and allow them to reach equilibrium, we find that they aren&#8217;t of equal stability. The trans isomer is more stable than the cis isomer by 2.8 kJ/mol (0.66 kcal/mol) at room temperature, corresponding to a 76&#33281;:&#33281;24 ratio.</para>

    <para>Cis alkenes are less stable than their trans isomers because of steric strain between the two larger substituents on the same side of the double bond. This is the same kind of steric interference that we saw previously in the axial conformation of methylcyclohexane (<link>Section 4.7</link>).</para>

    <para>Although it&#8217;s sometimes possible to find relative stabilities of alkene isomers by establishing a cis&#8211;trans equilibrium through treatment with strong acid, a more general method is to take advantage of the fact that alkenes undergo a <emphasis effect="italics">hydrogenation</emphasis> reaction to give the corresponding alkane when treated with H<sub>2</sub> gas in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium or platinum.</para>

    <para>Energy diagrams for the hydrogenation reactions of <emphasis effect="italics">cis</emphasis>- and <emphasis effect="italics">trans</emphasis>-2-butene are shown in <link>Figure 07_06_OChem-07-06-004_80485-07-05_CisTransGr</link>. Because <emphasis effect="italics">cis</emphasis>-2-butene is less stable than <emphasis effect="italics">trans</emphasis>-2-butene by 2.8 kJ/mol, the energy diagram shows the cis alkene at a higher energy level. After reaction, however, both curves are at the same energy level (butane). It therefore follows that &#916;<emphasis effect="italics">G</emphasis>&#176; for reaction of the cis isomer must be larger than &#916;<emphasis effect="italics">G</emphasis>&#176; for reaction of the trans isomer by 2.8 kJ/mol. In other words, more energy is released in the hydrogenation of the cis isomer than the trans isomer because the cis isomer has more energy to begin with.</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows a graph in which the x-axis plots the reaction progress in increasing order and y-axis plots the increasing energy. A pink curve represents hydrogenation of trans-2-butene. A green curve represents hydrogenation of cis-2-butene. The green curve starts at a higher point and the pink curve starts below it. Both curves end at the same point. A horizontal dashed line is labeled &#8216;Butane&#8217; where the end point of the curves falls. The vertical distance between the horizontal line and the starting point of pink curve is labeled &#8216;delta G&#176;trans&#8217; and the vertical distance between the horizontal line and the starting point of green curve is labeled &#8216;delta G&#176;cis.&#8217;">

    <para>If we were to measure the so-called heats of hydrogenation (&#916;<emphasis effect="italics">H</emphasis>&#176;<sub>hydrog</sub>) for two double-bond isomers and find their difference, we could determine the relative stabilities of cis and trans isomers without having to measure an equilibrium position. <emphasis effect="italics">cis</emphasis>-2-Butene, for instance, has <m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>&#x0394;</m:mi><m:mi>H</m:mi><m:msub><m:mtext>&#x00B0;</m:mtext><m:mrow><m:mtext>hydrog</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mtext>&#x2212;</m:mtext><m:mn>119</m:mn><m:mtext>&#x2004;</m:mtext><m:mtext>kJ/mol</m:mtext><m:mtext>&#x2004;</m:mtext><m:mo stretchy='false'>(</m:mo><m:mtext>&#x2212;</m:mtext><m:mn>28.3</m:mn><m:mtext>&#x2004;</m:mtext><m:mtext>kcal/mol</m:mtext><m:mo stretchy='false'>)</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math>, while <emphasis effect="italics">trans</emphasis>-2-butene has <m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>&#x0394;</m:mi><m:mi>H</m:mi><m:msub><m:mtext>&#x00B0;</m:mtext><m:mrow><m:mtext>hydrog</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mtext>&#x2212;</m:mtext><m:mn>115</m:mn><m:mtext>&#x2004;</m:mtext><m:mtext>kJ/mol</m:mtext><m:mtext>&#x2004;</m:mtext><m:mo stretchy='false'>(</m:mo><m:mtext>&#x2212;</m:mtext><m:mn>27.4</m:mn><m:mtext>&#x2004;</m:mtext><m:mtext>kcal/mol</m:mtext><m:mo stretchy='false'>)</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math>&#8212;a difference of 4 kJ/mol.</para>

    <para>The 4 kJ/mol energy difference between the 2-butene isomers calculated from heats of hydrogenation agrees reasonably well with the 2.8 kJ/mol energy difference calculated from equilibrium data, but the values aren&#8217;t exactly the same for two reasons. First, there is probably some experimental error, because heats of hydrogenation are difficult to measure accurately. Second, heats of reaction and equilibrium constants don&#8217;t measure exactly the same thing. Heats of reaction measure enthalpy changes, &#916;<emphasis effect="italics">H</emphasis>&#176;, whereas equilibrium constants measure free-energy changes, &#916;<emphasis effect="italics">G</emphasis>&#176;, so we might expect a slight difference between the two.</para>

    <para><link target-id="table-00001"/> lists some representative data for the hydrogenation of different alkenes and shows that alkenes become more stable with increasing substitution. That is, alkenes follow the stability order:</para>
    <figure class="unnumbered scaled-down">
    <media alt="An illustration shows the stability of alkenes in the following decreasing order: Tetrasubstituted alkene Trisubstituted alkene Disubstituted alkene and Monosubstituted alkene. All alkenes show two carbons double bonded. Tetrasubstituted alkene shows each carbon bonded to two R. Trisubstituted alkene shows a carbon bonded to two R and another carbon bonded to R and hydrogen. Disubstituted alkene shows two equivalent structures. In the first each carbon is bonded to two R and two hydrogens. in the second the first carbon is bonded to two R and the second carbon is bonded to two hydrogens.

    <para>The stability order of substituted alkenes is due to a combination of two factors. One is a stabilizing interaction between the C&#61;C <emphasis effect="italics">&#960;</emphasis> orbital and adjacent C &#8722; H <emphasis effect="italics">&#963;</emphasis> bonds on substituents. In valence-bond language, the interaction is called <term><emphasis effect="bold">hyperconjugation</emphasis></term>. In a molecular orbital description, there is a bonding MO that extends over the four-atom C&#61;C &#8722; C &#8722; H grouping, as shown in <link>Figure 07_06_OChem-07-06-007_80485-07-06_3Red3Blue</link>. The more substituents present on the double bond, the more hyperconjugation occurs and the more stable the alkene.</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows the cartoon representation and electrostatic potential map of an alkene. The cartoon model shows three sp2 orbitals. The center carbon is dash bonded to a hydrogen. The left carbon is dash bonded to a hydrogen and wedge bonded to a hydrogen.

    <caption>Hyperconjugation is a stabilizing interaction between the C═ C <emphasis effect="italics">&#960;</emphasis> orbital and adjacent C &#8722; H <emphasis effect="italics">&#963;</emphasis> bonds on substituents.

    <para>A second factor that contributes to alkene stability involves bond strengths. A bond between a <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>2</sup> carbon and a <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup> carbon is somewhat stronger than a bond between two <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup> carbons. Thus, in comparing 1-butene and 2-butene, the monosubstituted isomer has one <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup>&#8211;<emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup> bond and one <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup>&#8211;<emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>2</sup> bond, while the disubstituted isomer has two <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup>&#8211;<emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>2</sup> bonds. More highly substituted alkenes always have a higher ratio of <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup>&#8211;<emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>2</sup> bonds to <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup>&#8211;<emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup> bonds than less highly substituted alkenes and are therefore more stable.</para>
