<para id="para-00001">Pyruvate, produced by catabolism of glucose (and by degradation of several amino acids), can undergo several further transformations depending on the conditions and on the organism. In the absence of oxygen, pyruvate can either be reduced by NADH to yield lactate [CH<sub>3</sub>CH(OH)CO<sub>2</sub><sup>–</sup>] or, in yeast, fermented to give ethanol. Under typical aerobic conditions in mammals, however, pyruvate is converted by a process called <emphasis effect="italics">oxidative decarboxylation</emphasis> to give acetyl CoA plus CO<sub>2</sub>. (<emphasis effect="italics">Oxidative</emphasis> because the oxidation state of the carbonyl carbon rises from that of a ketone to that of a thioester.)</para>
<para id="para-00002">The conversion occurs through a multistep sequence of reactions catalyzed by a complex of enzymes and cofactors called the <emphasis effect="italics">pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.</emphasis> The process occurs in three stages, each catalyzed by one of the enzymes in the complex, as outlined in <link target-id="fig-00002"/>. Acetyl CoA, the ultimate product, then acts as fuel for the final stage of catabolism, the citric acid cycle.</para>

<title>Step <span class="magenta-text">1</span> of <link target-id="fig-00002"/>: Addition of Thiamin Diphosphate</title>
<para id="para-00003">The conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA begins by reaction of pyruvate with thiamin diphosphate, a derivative of vitamin B<sub>1</sub>. Formerly called thiamin <emphasis effect="italics">pyro</emphasis>phosphate, thiamin diphosphate is usually abbreviated as TPP. The spelling <emphasis effect="italics">thiamine</emphasis> is also correct and frequently used.</para>
<para id="para-00004">The key structural element in thiamin diphosphate is the thiazolium ring—a five-membered, unsaturated heterocycle containing a sulfur atom and a positively charged nitrogen atom. The thiazolium ring is weakly acidic, with a p<emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis><sub>a</sub> of approximately 18 for the ring hydrogen between N and S. Bases can therefore deprotonate thiamin diphosphate, leading to formation of an ylide much like the phosphonium ylides used in Wittig reactions (<link document="m00222"/>). As in the Wittig reaction, the TPP ylide is a nucleophile and adds to the ketone carbonyl group of pyruvate to yield an alcohol addition product.</para>
