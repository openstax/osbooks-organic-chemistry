    <para id="para-00001">Perhaps the most valuable reaction of alcohols is their oxidation to give carbonyl compounds—the opposite of the reduction of carbonyl compounds to give alcohols. Primary alcohols are oxidized either to aldehydes or carboxylic acids, and secondary alcohols are oxidized to ketones, but tertiary alcohols don’t normally react with most oxidizing agents.</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows three oxidation reactions. The first reaction shows a primary alcohol reacting with pink nascent oxygen to form an aldehyde that further reacts with pink nascent oxygen to form a carboxylic acid. The alcohol is shown as a centrally placed carbon bonded to pink hydroxyl group at the top the carbon is bonded to blue hydrogen wedge bonded to another blue hydrogen and dash bonded to R. An aldehyde shows a carbonyl group having pink oxygen bonded to R on the left and to blue hydrogen on the right. The carboxylic acid is shown as a carbonyl group with pink oxygen the carbon of carbonyl group is bonded to R on the left and to pink oxygen bonded to pink hydrogen on the right. The second reaction shows a secondary alcohol reacting with a pink nascent oxygen to form a ketone. The alcohol is shown as a centrally placed carbon bonded to pink hydroxyl group at the top the carbon is bonded to blue hydrogen dash bonded to R and wedge bonded to R’.

    <para id="para-00002">Primary and secondary alcohols can be oxidized by any of a number of reagents, including CrO<sub>3</sub> in aqueous acetic acid and KMnO<sub>4</sub> in aqueous NaOH, but chromium-based reagents are rarely used today because of their toxicity and fire danger. Today, primary and secondary alcohols are oxidized to aldehydes and ketones, respectively, using the iodine-containing <emphasis effect="italics">Dess–Martin periodinane</emphasis> in dichloromethane solution.</para>

In the Dess–Martin oxidation, for instance, the first step involves a substitution reaction between the alcohol and the I(V) reagent to form a new periodinane intermediate, followed by expulsion of reduced I(III) as the leaving group. Similarly, when a Cr(VI) reagent, such as CrO<sub>3</sub>, is the oxidant, reaction with the alcohol gives a chromate intermediate followed by expulsion of a reduced Cr(VI) species.</para>
