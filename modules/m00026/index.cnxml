    <para id="para-00001">Compilations of p<emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis><sub>a</sub> values like those in <link document="m00025" target-id="table-00001"/> and <link document="m00030"/> are useful for predicting whether a given acid–base reaction will take place, because H<sup>+</sup> will always go <emphasis effect="italics">from</emphasis> the stronger acid <emphasis effect="italics">to</emphasis> the stronger base. That is, an acid will donate a proton to the conjugate base of a weaker acid, and the conjugate base of a weaker acid will remove a proton from a stronger acid. Since water (p<emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis><sub>a</sub> = 15.74) is a weaker acid than acetic acid (p<emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis><sub>a</sub> = 4.76), for example, hydroxide ion holds a proton more tightly than acetate ion does. Hydroxide ion will therefore react to a large extent with acetic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H, to yield acetate ion and H<sub>2</sub>O.</para>

      <media alt="An illustration shows 4 electron photostatic maps with along with the kekulé line bond structure. The first illustration image shows a multicolored electron map that has a ball-and stick-model which shows 2 gray balls representing carbon atoms 4 ivory balls representing hydrogen atoms and 2 red balls representing oxygen atom. The second illustration image shows a red electron map with red balls representing oxygen atom and ivory ball representing hydrogen atom. The third illustration image shows an electron photostatic map that is partially red and green with shades of yellow in between. The ball and stick model shown here has 2 gray balls representing oxygen atoms 2 red balls representing oxygen atoms and 4 ivory balls representing hydrogen atoms. The fourth illustration image shows an electron map that shows the color gradient ranging from purple blue green yellow and red. The ball and stick model on this map shows a red ball representing oxygen atom and 2 ivory balls representing hydrogen atoms. The corresponding kekulé line bond is show through 4 other images. The first kekulé line bond structure labeled “Acetic acid” shows a central carbon atom single bonded to another carbon atom which shares a line dashed and wedged bond with 3 hydrogen atoms. The central carbon atom also shares a single bond with an oxygen atom with 2 pairs of electrons which in turn is single bonded to a hydrogen atom and a double bond with another oxygen atom with 2 pairs of electrons. This structure combines with a hydroxide ion which is shows as a hydrogen atom single bonded to a negatively charged oxygen atom with 3 pairs of electrons. The resultant reversible reaction between them results in an acetate ion that is shown as a central carbon atom double bonded with an oxygen atom with 2 pairs of electrons and single bonded with a negatively charged oxygen atom with 3 pairs of electrons. The carbon atom also shows a single bond with another carbon atom that shares a line dashed and wedged bond with three hydrogen atoms. The resultant water is shown as an oxygen atom with 2 pairs of electrons single bonded to 2 hydrogen atoms.">

      <para id="para-00002">Another way to predict acid–base reactivity is to remember that the product conjugate acid in an acid–base reaction must be weaker and less reactive than the starting acid and the product conjugate base must be weaker and less reactive than the starting base. In the reaction of acetic acid with hydroxide ion, for example, the product conjugate acid (H<sub>2</sub>O) is weaker than the starting acid (CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H), and the product conjugate base (CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>–</sup>) is weaker than the starting base (OH<sup>–</sup>).</para>

      <media alt="An illustration shows the reversible reaction between a stronger acid and stronger base resulting in a weaker acid and weaker base. The stronger acid is shown as a carbon atom single bonded to a methyl group double bonded to an oxygen atom and single bonded to a hydroxyl group. Stronger base is shown as a negatively charged hydroxyl group. Weaker acid is shown as an oxygen atom single bonded to 2 hydrogen atoms. Weaker base is shown as a carbon atom single bonded to a methyl group double bonded to an oxygen atom and single bonded to a negatively charged oxygen atom.">
