    <para id="para-00001">The most general method for preparing alcohols, both in the laboratory and in living organisms, is by reduction of a carbonyl compound. Just as reduction of an alkene adds hydrogen to a <m:math><m:mrow><m:mtext>C=C</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> bond to give an alkane (<link document="m00094"/>), reduction of a carbonyl compound adds hydrogen to a <m:math><m:mrow><m:mtext>C=O</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> bond to give an alcohol. All kinds of carbonyl compounds can be reduced, including aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and esters.</para>

    <title>Reduction of Aldehydes and Ketones</title>

    <para id="para-00003">Dozens of reagents are used in the laboratory to reduce aldehydes and ketones, depending on the circumstances, but sodium borohydride, NaBH<sub>4</sub>, is usually chosen because of its safety and ease of handling. Sodium borohydride is a white, crystalline solid that can be weighed in the open atmosphere and used in either water or alcohol solution.</para>

    <para id="para-00004">Lithium aluminum hydride, LiAlH<sub>4</sub>, is another reducing agent often used for reduction of aldehydes and ketones. A grayish powder that is soluble in ether and tetrahydrofuran, LiAlH<sub>4</sub> is much more reactive than NaBH<sub>4</sub> but also much more dangerous. It reacts violently with water and decomposes explosively when heated above 120 °C.</para>

    <para id="para-00005">We’ll defer a detailed discussion of these reductions until Chapter 19. For the moment, we’ll simply note that they involve the addition of a nucleophilic hydride ion (<emphasis effect="bold">:</emphasis>H<sup>–</sup>) to the positively polarized, electrophilic carbon atom of the carbonyl group. The initial product is an alkoxide ion, which is protonated by addition of H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> in a second step to yield the alcohol product.</para>

    <para id="para-00006">In living organisms, aldehyde and ketone reductions are carried out by either of the coenzymes NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) or NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). Although these biological “reagents” are much more complex structurally than NaBH<sub>4</sub> or LiAlH<sub>4</sub>, the mechanisms of laboratory and biological reactions are similar. The coenzyme acts as a hydride-ion donor to give an alkoxide anion, and the intermediate anion is then protonated by acid. An example is the reduction of acetoacetyl ACP to <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-hydroxybutyryl ACP, a step in the biological synthesis of fats (<link target-id="fig-00006"/>). Note that the pro-<emphasis effect="italics">R</emphasis> hydrogen of NADPH is the one transferred in this example. Enzyme-catalyzed reactions usually occur with high specificity, although it’s not usually possible to predict the stereochemical result before the fact.</para>

    <para id="para-00008">These reactions aren’t as rapid as the reductions of aldehydes and ketones. NaBH<sub>4</sub> reduces esters very slowly and does not reduce carboxylic acids at all. Instead, carboxylic acid and ester reductions are usually carried out with the more reactive reducing agent LiAlH<sub>4</sub>. All carbonyl groups, including acids, esters, ketones, and aldehydes, are reduced by LiAlH<sub>4</sub>. Note that one hydrogen atom is delivered to the carbonyl carbon atom during aldehyde and ketone reductions but that two hydrogens become bonded to the former carbonyl carbon during carboxylic acid and ester reductions. We’ll defer a discussion of the mechanisms of these reactions until Chapter 21.</para>
