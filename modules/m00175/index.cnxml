    <title>The Dienophile</title>
    <para id="para-00001">The Diels–Alder cycloaddition reaction occurs most rapidly if the alkene component, called the <term id="term-00001">dienophile</term> (“diene lover”), has an electron-withdrawing substituent group. Thus, ethylene itself reacts sluggishly, but propenal, ethyl propenoate, maleic anhydride, benzoquinone, propenenitrile, and similar compounds are highly reactive. Note also that alkynes, such as methyl propynoate, can act as Diels–Alder dienophiles.</para>

    <para id="para-00002">In all cases, the double or triple bond of the dienophile is adjacent to the positively polarized carbon of an electron-withdrawing substituent. As a result, the double-bond carbons in these substances are substantially less electron-rich than the carbons in ethylene, as indicated by the electrostatic potential maps in <link target-id="fig-00002"/>.</para>

    <para id="para-00003">One of the most useful features of the Diels–Alder reaction is that it is <term id="term-00002">stereospecific</term>, meaning that a single product stereoisomer is formed. Furthermore, the stereochemistry of the dienophile is retained. If we carry out cycloaddition with methyl <emphasis effect="italics">cis</emphasis>-2-butenoate, only the cis-substituted cyclohexene product is formed. With methyl <emphasis effect="italics">trans</emphasis>-2-butenoate, only the trans-substituted cyclohexene product is formed.</para>

    <media alt="The first reaction shows 1,3-butadiene reacting with methyl (Z)-2-butenoate to yield a cis product. The second reaction shows 1,3-butadiene reacting with methyl (E)-2-butenoate to yield trans product.">

    </media>
    </figure>
    <para id="para-00004">Another stereochemical feature of the Diels–Alder reaction is that the diene and dienophile partners orient so that the endo product, rather than the alternative exo product, is formed. The words <emphasis effect="italics">endo</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">exo</emphasis> are used to indicate relative stereochemistry when referring to bicyclic structures like substituted norbornanes (<link document="m00048"/>). A substituent on one bridge is said to be <term id="term-00003">endo</term> if it is syn (cis) to the larger of the other two bridges and is said to be <term id="term-00004">exo</term> if it is anti (trans) to the larger of the other two.</para>

    </media>
    </figure>
    <para id="para-00005">Endo products result from Diels–Alder reactions because the amount of orbital overlap between diene and dienophile is greater when the reactants lie directly on top of one another, so that the electron-withdrawing substituent on the dienophile is underneath the diene double bonds. In the reaction of 1,3-cyclopentadiene with maleic anhydride, for instance, the following result is obtained:</para>
