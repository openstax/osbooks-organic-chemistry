<para id="para-00001">Carbohydrates are generally classified as either simple or complex. <term id="term-00001">Simple sugars</term>, or <term id="term-00002">monosaccharides</term>, are carbohydrates like glucose and fructose that canâ€™t be converted into smaller sugars by hydrolysis. <term id="term-00003">Complex carbohydrates</term> are made of two or more simple sugars linked together by acetal bonds (<link document="m00221"/>). Sucrose (table sugar), for instance, consists of one glucose linked to one fructose. Similarly, cellulose is made up of several thousand glucose units linked together. Enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of a complex carbohydrate breaks it down into its constituent monosaccharides.</para>

<media alt="An illustration shows two chemical reactions. In the first reaction sucrose (a disaccharide) reacts with pink hydronium ion to yield 1 unit of glucose and 1 unit of fructose. Sucrose shows chair conformation of a cyclohexane and Haworth projection of a cyclohexane bonded to a common pink oxygen. The chair conformation is bonded to three hydroxyl groups and a hydroxy methyl group. The Haworth projection is bonded to two hydroxyl groups and two hydroxy methyl groups. In the second reaction cellulose (a polysaccharide) reacts with pink hydronium ion to yield approximately 3000 units of glucose. Cellulose shows chair conformation of two cyclohexane rings bonded to a common pink oxygen. Each chair conformation is bonded to two hydroxyl groups a hydroxy methyl group and a pink oxygen that shows a free bond with a pink wavy line.">

<para id="para-00002">Monosaccharides are further classified as either <term id="term-00004">aldoses</term> or <term id="term-00005">ketoses</term>. The -<emphasis effect="italics">ose</emphasis> suffix designates a carbohydrate, and the prefixes <emphasis effect="italics">aldo</emphasis>- and <emphasis effect="italics">keto</emphasis>- identify the kind of carbonyl group in the molecule, whether aldehyde or ketone. The number of carbon atoms in the monosaccharide is indicated by the appropriate numerical prefix <emphasis effect="italics">tri</emphasis>-, <emphasis effect="italics">tetr</emphasis>-, <emphasis effect="italics">pent</emphasis>-, <emphasis effect="italics">hex</emphasis>-, and so forth, in the name. Putting it all together, glucose is an aldohexose, a six-carbon aldehyde sugar; fructose is a ketohexose, a six-carbon keto sugar; ribose is an aldopentose, a five-carbon aldehyde sugar; and sedoheptulose is a ketoheptose, a seven-carbon keto sugar. Most of the common simple sugars are either pentoses or hexoses.</para>

<media alt="An illustration shows Fisher projections of four monosaccharides. The first structure shows glucose an aldohexose where C1 of the six-carbon chain is an aldehyde group. The hydroxyl groups bonded to C2 C4 and C5 lie on the right of the carbon and the hydrogen atoms bonded to the carbons lie on the left. But at C3 the hydrogen lies on the right and the hydroxyl on the left. C6 is bonded to two hydrogen atoms and a hydroxyl group on the right. The second structure shows fructose a ketohexose where C1 is bonded to two hydrogen atoms and a hydroxyl group; C2 is a keto group. The hydroxyl group on C4 and C5 lie on the right while that on C3 lies on the left. The hydrogen on C4 and C5 lie on the left while that on C3 lies on the right. C6 is bonded to two hydrogen atoms and a hydroxyl group on the right. The third structure shows ribose an aldopentose where C1 of the five-carbon chain is an aldehyde group. The hydroxyl groups on C2 C3 and C4 lie on the right of the carbon and the hydrogen atoms bonded to the carbons lie on the left. C5 is bonded to two hydrogen atoms and a hydroxyl group. The fourth structure shows sedoheptulose a ketoheptose. The first carbon of the seven-carbon chain is bonded to two hydrogen atoms and a hydroxyl group. C2 is a keto group. The hydroxyl group on C4 C5 and C6 lie on the right while that on C3 lies on the left. The hydrogen on C4 C5 and C6 lie on the left while that on C3 lies on the right. C7 satisfies is bonded to two hydrogen atoms and a hydroxyl group on the right.">
