    <para id="para-00001">Look carefully at the electrophilic addition reactions shown in the previous section. In each case, an unsymmetrically substituted alkene has given a single addition product rather than the mixture that might be expected. For example, 2-methylpropene might react with HCl to give both 2-chloro-2-methylpropane and 1-chloro-2-methylpropane, but it doesn’t. It gives only 2-chloro-2-methylpropane as the sole product. Similarly, it’s invariably the case in biological alkene addition reactions that only a single product is formed. We say that such reactions are <term id="term-00001">regiospecific</term> (<emphasis effect="bold">ree</emphasis>-jee-oh-specific) when only one of two possible orientations of an addition occurs.</para>

In the present instance, the reactant is an alkene that will probably undergo an electrophilic addition reaction with HCl. Next, recall what you know about electrophilic addition reactions to predict the product. You know that electrophilic addition reactions follow Markovnikov’s rule, so H<sup>+</sup> will add to the double-bond carbon that has one alkyl group (C2 on the ring) and the Cl will add to the double-bond carbon that has two alkyl groups (C1 on the ring).</para>
