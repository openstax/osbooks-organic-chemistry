    <para id="para-00001">Having looked at the kinds of reactions that take place, let’s now see how they occur. An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a <term id="term-00001">reaction mechanism</term>. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation—which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.</para>
<para id="para-00002">All chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be <emphasis effect="italics">heterolytic</emphasis>, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be <emphasis effect="italics">homolytic</emphasis>.</para>
<para id="para-00003">We’ll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of <emphasis effect="italics">two</emphasis> electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow (<media alt="Alt Text Placeholder"><image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/OChem_06_02_002.jpg"/></media>, whereas the movement of <emphasis effect="italics">one</emphasis> electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or “fishhook,” arrow (<media alt="Alt Text Placeholder"><image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/OChem_06_02_001.jpg"/></media>).</para>

<media alt="An illustration shows two parts. The first part reads “Unsymmetrical bond-breaking (polar): two bonding electrons stay with one product” the accompanying reaction shows pink “A” sharing a pair of blue electrons with blue “B”; a blue arrow points from the electrons to blue “B”; the products formed are pink “A” cation and a blue “B” anion. The second part reads “Symmetrical bond-breaking (radical): one bonding electron stays with each product” the accompanying reaction shows pink “A” sharing a pink and blue electrons with blue “B”; pink electron is placed above the blue electron; an upward tiny pink arrow with a partial head points from pink electron to pink “A” and a downward blue arrow with a partial head points from the blue electron to blue “B”; the products formed are pink “A” having a pink electron and a blue “B” having a blue electron.">

<para id="para-00004">Just as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.</para>

<media alt="An illustration shows two parts. The first part reads “unsymmetrical bond-making (polar): two bonding electrons are donated by one reactant”; the accompanying reaction shows a pink “A” cation reacting with a blue “B” anion having a pair of electrons to form a pink “A” sharing a pair of blue electrons with blue “B.” The second part reads “Symmetrical bond-breaking (radical): one bonding electron stays with each product” the accompanying reaction shows pink “A” with a pink electron reacting with a blue “B” with a blue electron; a pink arrow with partial head points from the pink electron to a spot near “B”; a blue arrow with partial head points from the blue electron to the same spot where pink arrow points; the product of reaction is pink “A” sharing a pink and blue electron with blue “B.”">

<para id="para-00005">Processes that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called <term id="term-00002">polar reactions</term>. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.</para>
<para id="para-00006">Processes that involve symmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called <term id="term-00003">radical reactions</term>. A <term id="term-00004">radical</term>, often called a <emphasis effect="bold">free radical</emphasis>, is a neutral chemical species that contains an odd number of electrons and thus has a single, unpaired electron in one of its orbitals.</para>
<para id="para-00007">In addition to polar and radical reactions, there is a third, less commonly encountered process called a <emphasis effect="italics">pericyclic reaction</emphasis>. Rather than explain pericyclic reactions now, though, we’ll look at them more carefully in Chapter 30.</para>
