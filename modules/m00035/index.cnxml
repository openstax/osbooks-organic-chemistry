    <para id="para-00001">In earlier times, when relatively few pure organic chemicals were known, new compounds were named at the whim of their discoverer. Thus, urea (CH<sub>4</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O) is a crystalline substance isolated from urine; morphine (C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>19</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>) is an analgesic (painkiller) named after Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams; and acetic acid, the primary organic constituent of vinegar, is named from the Latin word for vinegar, <emphasis effect="italics">acetum</emphasis>.</para>
    <para id="para-00002">As the science of organic chemistry slowly grew in the 19th century, so too did the number of known compounds and the need for a systematic method of naming them. The system of naming (nomenclature) we’ll use in this book is that devised by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC, usually spoken as <emphasis effect="bold">eye</emphasis>-you-pac).</para>
    <para id="para-00003">A chemical name typically has four parts in the IUPAC system: parent, prefix, locant, and suffix. The <emphasis effect="bold">parent</emphasis> name identifies the main part of the molecule and tells how many carbon atoms are in that part. <emphasis effect="bold">Prefixes</emphasis> identify the various <term id="term-00001">substituent</term> groups attached to the parent. <emphasis effect="bold">Locants</emphasis> give the positions of the attached substituents. And the <emphasis effect="bold">suffix</emphasis> identifies the primary functional group attached to the parent.</para>
