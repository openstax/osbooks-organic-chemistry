    <title>The E1 Reaction</title>
    <para id="para-00001">Just as the E2 reaction is analogous to the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction has a close analog called the <term id="term-00001">E1 reaction</term> (for elimination, unimolecular). The E1 reaction can be formulated as shown in <link target-id="fig-00001"/>, with the elimination of HCl from 2-chloro-2-methylpropane.</para>

    <title>MECHANISM</title>
    <media alt="An illustration shows a 2-step reaction. 2-Chloro-2-methylpropane undergoes rate-limiting step to produce chloride ion and carbocation that reacts with base to produce neutral alkene. 2-Chloro-2-methylpropane shows a carbon bonded to chlorine and three methyl groups. Text reads: Spontaneous dissociation of the tertiary alkyl chloride yields an intermediate carbocation in a slow rate-limiting step. Carbocation shows a carbon cation bonded to three methyl groups. The base shows two electrons. An arrow from the electrons points to a hydrogen of the carbocation. An arrow from the C-H bond points to C-C bond. Text reads: Loss of a neighboring H+ in a fast step yields the neutral alkene product. The electron pair from the C–H bond goes to form the alkene pi bond. The neutral alkene shows two carbons double bonded. One carbon is bonded to two methyl groups and the other carbon is bonded to two hydrogens.">

    <para id="para-00002">E1 eliminations begin with the same unimolecular dissociation to give a carbocation that we saw in the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction, but the dissociation is followed by loss of H<sup>+</sup> from the adjacent carbon rather than by substitution. In fact, the E1 and S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions normally occur together whenever an alkyl halide is treated in a protic solvent with a nonbasic nucleophile. Thus, the best E1 substrates are also the best S<sub>N</sub>1 substrates, and mixtures of substitution and elimination products are usually obtained. For example, when 2-chloro-2-methylpropane is warmed to 65 °C in 80% aqueous ethanol, a 64 : 36 mixture of 2-methyl-2-propanol (S<sub>N</sub>1) and 2-methylpropene (E1) results.</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows a reaction of 2-Chloro-2-methylpropane in the presence of water and ethanol at 65 degree C to produce 2-Methyl-2-propanol 64%) and 2-Methylpropene (36%). 2-Chloro-2-methylpropane shows a carbon bonded to three methyl groups and a chlorine. 2-Methyl-2-propanol shows a carbon bonded to three methyl groups and a hydroxyl group. 2-Methylpropene shows two carbons double bonded. The right carbon is bonded to two hydrogens. The left carbon is bonded to two methyl groups.">

    <para id="para-00003">Much evidence has been obtained in support of the E1 mechanism. For example, E1 reactions show first-order kinetics, consistent with a rate-limiting, unimolecular dissociation process. Furthermore, E1 reactions show no deuterium isotope effect because rupture of the C–H (or C–D) bond occurs after the rate-limiting step rather than during it. Thus, we can’t measure a rate difference between a deuterated and nondeuterated substrate.</para>
    <para id="para-00004">A final piece of evidence involves the stereochemistry of elimination. Unlike the E2 reaction, where anti periplanar geometry is required, there is no geometric requirement on the E1 reaction because the halide and the hydrogen are lost in separate steps. We might therefore expect to obtain the more stable (Zaitsev’s rule) product from E1 reaction, which is just what we find. To return to a familiar example, menthyl chloride loses HCl under E1 conditions in a polar solvent to give a mixture of alkenes in which the Zaitsev product, 3-menthene, predominates (<link target-id="fig-00003"/>).</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows two reactions of Menthyl chloride. Under E2 conditions (1.0 M sodium ethoxide in ethanol at 100 °C) the reactant yields 2-Menthene (100%). Under E1 conditions (0.01 M sodium ethoxide in 80% aqueous ethanol at 160 °C) the reactant yields 2-Menthene (32%) and 3-Menthene (68%). Two chair conformations of menthyl chloride are shown. Each structure shows a hexane bonded to two hydrogens a chlorine a methyl group and a methine group bonded to two methyl groups. 2-Menthene shows a cyclohexene bonded to a methyl group bonded to C2. C5 is bonded to a hydrogen and a methine group bonded to two methyl groups. 3-Menthene shows a cyclohexene bonded to a methyl group bonded to C3. C2 is bonded to a hydrogen. C6 is bonded to a methine group bonded to two methyl groups.">

    <title>The E1cB Reaction</title>
    <para id="para-00005">In contrast to the E1 reaction, which involves a carbocation intermediate, the <term id="term-00002">E1cB reaction</term> takes place through a carbanion intermediate. Base-induced abstraction of a proton in a slow, rate-limiting step gives an anion, which expels a leaving group on the adjacent carbon. The reaction is particularly common in substrates that have a poor leaving group, such as –OH, two carbons removed from a carbonyl group, as in HOC—CH—C=O. The poor leaving group disfavors the alternative E1 and E2 possibilities, and the carbonyl group makes the adjacent hydrogen unusually acidic by resonance stabilization of the anion intermediate. We’ll look at this acidifying effect of a carbonyl group in <emphasis effect="bold">Section 22.5</emphasis>.</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows the reaction of a carbonyl compound with a base to produce two resonance-stabilized anions that further yields the final product.

The base shows two electrons. An arrow from the electrons points to the hydrogen bonded to C2. An arrow from the H-C2 bond points to C2. The first resonance-stabilized anion is similar to the reactant but C2 shows a negative charge and two electrons. It is not bonded to hydrogen. An arrow from the charge of C2 points to C1-C2 bond. An arrow from the carbonyl bond points to oxygen. The second resonance-stabilized anion is similar to the first anion but C2 shows no charge or electrons. C2 is double bonded to hydrogen. C1 is single bonded to oxygen that shows six electrons and a negative charge. An arrow from the oxygen points to O-C1 bond. An arrow from the C1-C2 bond points to C2-C3 bond.
