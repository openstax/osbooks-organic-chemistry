    <para id="para-00001">How does electron sharing lead to bonding between atoms? Two models have been developed to describe covalent bonding: <emphasis effect="italics">valence bond theory</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">molecular orbital theory</emphasis>. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and chemists tend to use them interchangeably depending on the circumstances. Valence bond theory is the more easily visualized of the two, so most of the descriptions we’ll use in this book derive from that approach.</para>
    <para id="para-00002">According to <term id="term-00001">valence bond (VB) theory</term>, a covalent bond forms when two atoms approach each other closely and a singly occupied orbital on one atom <emphasis effect="italics">overlaps</emphasis> a singly occupied orbital on the other atom. The electrons are now paired in the overlapping orbitals and are attracted to the nuclei of both atoms, thus bonding the atoms together. In the H<sub>2</sub> molecule, for instance, the H–H bond results from the overlap of two singly occupied hydrogen 1<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> orbitals.</para>

    <para id="para-00003">The overlapping orbitals in the H<sub>2</sub> molecule have the elongated egg shape we might get by pressing two spheres together. If a plane were to pass through the middle of the bond, the intersection of the plane and the overlapping orbitals would be a circle. In other words, the H–H bond is cylindrically symmetrical, as shown in <link target-id="fig-00002"/>. Such bonds, which are formed by the head-on overlap of two atomic orbitals along a line drawn between the nuclei, are called <term id="term-00002">sigma (<emphasis effect="italics">σ</emphasis>) bonds</term>.</para>

Because the product H<sub>2</sub> molecule has 436 kJ/mol less energy than the starting 2 H<emphasis effect="bold">·</emphasis> atoms, the product is more stable than the reactant and we say that the H–H bond has a <term id="term-00003">bond strength</term> of 436 kJ/mol. In other words, we would have to put 436 kJ/mol of energy into the H–H bond to break the H<sub>2</sub> molecule apart into two H atoms (<link target-id="fig-00003"/>). For convenience, we’ll generally give energies in both kilocalories (kcal) and the SI unit kilojoules (kJ): 1 kJ = 0.2390 kcal; 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ.</para>

    <para id="para-00005">How close are the two nuclei in the H<sub>2</sub> molecule? If they are too close, they will repel each other because both are positively charged. Yet if they’re too far apart, they won’t be able to share the bonding electrons. Thus, there is an optimum distance between nuclei that leads to maximum stability (<link target-id="fig-00004"/>). Called the <term id="term-00004">bond length</term>, this distance is 74 pm in the H–H molecule. Every covalent bond has both a characteristic bond strength and bond length.</para>
