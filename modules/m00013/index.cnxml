    <para id="para-00001">We said in <link document="m00007">Describing Chemical Bonds: Valence Bond Theory</link> that chemists use two models for describing covalent bonds: valence bond theory and molecular orbital theory. Having now seen the valence bond approach, which uses hybrid atomic orbitals to account for geometry and assumes the overlap of atomic orbitals to account for electron sharing, let’s look briefly at the molecular orbital approach to bonding. We’ll return to this topic in Chapters <link>14</link>, <link>15</link>, and <link>30</link> for a more in-depth discussion.</para>

      Like an atomic orbital, a molecular orbital has a specific size, shape, and energy. In the H<sub>2</sub> molecule, for example, two singly occupied 1<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> atomic orbitals combine to form two molecular orbitals. There are two ways for the orbital combination to occur—an additive way and a subtractive way. The additive combination leads to formation of a molecular orbital that is lower in energy and roughly egg-shaped, while the subtractive combination leads to a molecular orbital that is higher in energy and has a node between nuclei (<link target-id="OChem_01_11_001.jpg"/>). Note that the additive combination is a single, egg-shaped, molecular orbital; it is not the same as the two overlapping 1<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> atomic orbitals of the valence bond description. Similarly, the subtractive combination is a single molecular orbital with the shape of an elongated dumbbell.

      The additive combination is lower in energy than the two hydrogen 1<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> atomic orbitals and is called a <term id="term-00005">bonding MO</term> because electrons in this MO spend most of their time in the region between the two nuclei, thereby bonding the atoms together. The subtractive combination is higher in energy than the two hydrogen 1<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> orbitals and is called an <term id="term-00006">antibonding MO</term> because any electrons it contains <emphasis effect="italics">can’t</emphasis> occupy the central region between the nuclei, where there is a node, and thus can’t contribute to bonding. The two nuclei therefore repel each other.
