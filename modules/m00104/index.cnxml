    <para>Alkynes can be prepared by the elimination of HX from alkyl halides in a similar manner as alkenes (<link document="m00089">Section 8.1</link>). Treatment of a 1,2-dihaloalkane (called a <emphasis effect="italics">vicinal</emphasis> dihalide) with an excess amount of a strong base such as KOH or NaNH<sub>2</sub> results in a twofold elimination of HX and formation of an alkyne. As with the elimination of HX to form an alkene, we&#8217;ll defer a full discussion of this topic and the relevant reaction mechanisms to the chapter on [link]Reactions of Alkyl Halides: Nucleophilic Substitutions and Eliminations[/link].</para>
    <para>The starting vicinal dihalides are themselves readily available by addition of Br<sub>2</sub> or Cl<sub>2</sub> to alkenes. Thus, the overall halogenation/dehydrohalogenation sequence makes it possible to go from an alkene to an alkyne. For example, diphenylethylene is converted into diphenylacetylene by reaction with Br<sub>2</sub> and subsequent base treatment.</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows &#8220;1 2-Diphenylethylene (stilbene) reacting in the presence of bromine and chloromethane to yield &#8220;1 2-Dibromo-1 2-diphenylethane (a vicinal dibromide)&#8221; that further reacts in the presence of two moles of potassium hydroxide and ethanol to yield &#8220;Diphenylacetylene (85%)&#8221; two moles of water and two moles of potassium bromide. The potassium atoms are shown in blue and the bromine atoms are shown in pink. The structure of stilbene shows a benzene bonded to methine group that is double bonded to another methine group bonded to a benzene. A vicinal dibromide shows a benzene bonded to a carbon bonded to a bromine and hydrogen; the carbon is bonded to another carbon bonded to a hydrogen bromine and a benzene. The structure of diphenylacetylene shows two centrally placed carbons triple bonded to each other; each carbon is bonded to a benzene.">

    <para>The twofold dehydrohalogenation takes place through a vinylic halide intermediate, which suggests that vinylic halides themselves should give alkynes when treated with strong base. (A vinylic substituent is one that is attached to a double-bond.) This is indeed the case. For example:</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows &#8220;(Z)-3-Chloro-2-buten-1-ol&#8221; reacting in the presence of two moles of sodium amide and a hydronium ion to yield &#8220;2-Butyn-1-ol.&#8221; The first structure &#8220;(Z)-3-Chloro-2-buten-1-ol&#8221; shows a carbon double bonded to another carbon; the carbon at left shares an upward angled bond with a methyl group and a downward angled bond with chlorine; the carbon at right shares an upward angled bond with hydrogen and a downward angled bond with hydroxymethyl group. The structure of &#8220;2-Butyn-1-ol&#8221; shows a methyl group bonded to carbon that is triple bonded to another carbon bonded to a hydroxymethyl group.">
