    <para id="para-00001">Alkynes can be prepared by the elimination of HX from alkyl halides in a similar manner as alkenes (<link document="m00089"/>). Treatment of a 1,2-dihaloalkane (called a <emphasis effect="italics">vicinal</emphasis> dihalide) with an excess amount of a strong base such as KOH or NaNH<sub>2</sub> results in a twofold elimination of HX and formation of an alkyne. As with the elimination of HX to form an alkene, weâ€™ll defer a full discussion of this topic and the relevant reaction mechanisms to Chapter 11.</para>
    <para id="para-00002">The starting vicinal dihalides are themselves readily available by addition of Br<sub>2</sub> or Cl<sub>2</sub> to alkenes. Thus, the overall halogenation/dehydrohalogenation sequence makes it possible to go from an alkene to an alkyne. For example, diphenylethylene is converted into diphenylacetylene by reaction with Br<sub>2</sub> and subsequent base treatment.</para>

    <para id="para-00003">The twofold dehydrohalogenation takes place through a vinylic halide intermediate, which suggests that vinylic halides themselves should give alkynes when treated with strong base. (A vinylic substituent is one that is attached to a double-bond.) This is indeed the case. For example:</para>
