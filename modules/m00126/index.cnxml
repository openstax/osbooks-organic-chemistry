    <para id="para-00001">Just as the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction is strongly influenced by the structure of the substrate, the leaving group, the nucleophile, and the solvent, the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction is similarly influenced. Factors that lower ∆<emphasis effect="italics">G</emphasis><sup>‡</sup>, either by lowering the energy level of the transition state or by raising the energy level of the ground state, favor faster S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions. Conversely, factors that raise ∆<emphasis effect="italics">G</emphasis><sup>‡</sup>, either by raising the energy level of the transition state or by lowering the energy level of the reactant, slow down the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction.</para>

    <title>The Substrate</title>
    <para id="para-00002">According to the Hammond postulate (<link document="m00072"/>), any factor that stabilizes a high-energy intermediate also stabilizes the transition state leading to that intermediate. Because the rate-limiting step in an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction is the spontaneous, unimolecular dissociation of the substrate to yield a carbocation, the reaction is favored whenever a stabilized carbocation intermediate is formed. The more stable the carbocation intermediate, the faster the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction.</para>
    <para id="para-00003">We saw in <link document="m00071"/> that the stability order of alkyl carbocations is 3° > 2° > 1° > methyl. To this list we should also add the resonance-stabilized allyl and benzyl cations. Just as allylic radicals are unusually stable because the unpaired electron can be delocalized over an extended <emphasis effect="italics">π</emphasis> orbital system (<link document="m00116"/>), so allylic and benzylic carbocations are unusually stable. (The word <term id="term-00001">benzylic</term> means “next to an aromatic ring.”) As <link target-id="fig-00001"/> indicates, an allylic cation has two resonance forms. In one form, the double bond is on the “left”; in the other form it’s on the “right.” A benzylic cation has five resonance forms, all of which contribute to the overall resonance hybrid.</para>

    </figure>
    <para id="para-00004">Because of resonance stabilization, a primary allylic or benzylic carbocation is about as stable as a secondary alkyl carbocation, and a secondary allylic or benzylic carbocation is about as stable as a tertiary alkyl carbocation. This stability order of carbocations is the same as the order of S<sub>N</sub>1 reactivity for alkyl halides and tosylates.</para>

    <para id="para-00005">We should also note parenthetically that primary allylic and benzylic substrates are particularly reactive in S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions as well as in S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions. Allylic and benzylic C–X bonds are about 50 kJ/mol (12 kcal/mol) weaker than the corresponding saturated bonds and are therefore more easily broken.</para>

    <title>The Leaving Group</title>
    <para id="para-00008">We said during the discussion of S<sub>N</sub>2 reactivity that the best leaving groups are those that are most stable; that is, those that are the conjugate bases of strong acids. An identical reactivity order is found for the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction because the leaving group is directly involved in the rate-limiting step. Thus, the S<sub>N</sub>1 reactivity order is</para>

    <media alt="Leaving group reactivity in increasing order: hydroxyl, chloride, bromide, iodide or T o S O ion (these are equivalent), and water.">

    </media>
    </figure>
    <para id="para-00009">Note that in the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction, which is often carried out under acidic conditions, neutral water is sometimes the leaving group. This occurs, for example, when an alkyl halide is prepared from a tertiary alcohol by reaction with HBr or HCl (<link document="m00117"/>). As shown in <link target-id="fig-00005"/>, the alcohol is first protonated and then spontaneously loses H<sub>2</sub>O to generate a carbocation, which reacts with halide ion to give the alkyl halide. Knowing that an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction is involved in the conversion of alcohols to alkyl halides explains why the reaction works well only for tertiary alcohols. Tertiary alcohols react fastest because they give the most stable carbocation intermediates.</para>

    <title>The Nucleophile</title>
    <para id="para-00010">The nature of the nucleophile plays a major role in the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction but does not affect an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction. Because the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction occurs through a rate-limiting step in which the added nucleophile has no part, the nucleophile can’t affect the reaction rate. The reaction of 2-methyl-2-propanol with HX, for instance, occurs at the same rate regardless of whether X is Cl, Br, or I. Furthermore, neutral nucleophiles are just as effective as negatively charged ones, so S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions frequently occur under neutral or acidic conditions.</para>

    <title>The Solvent</title>
    <para id="para-00011">What about the solvent? Do solvents have the same effect in S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions that they have in S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile <emphasis effect="italics">reactant,</emphasis> while solvent effects in the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the <emphasis effect="italics">transition state</emphasis>.</para>
    <para id="para-00012">The Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction. Solvation of the carbocation—the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules—has such an effect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (<link target-id="fig-00007"/>), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.</para>

    </figure>
    <para id="para-00013">The properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent’s polarity. S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can’t be measured accurately.</para>

    <para id="para-00014">It should be emphasized again that both the S<sub>N</sub>1 and the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction show solvent effects, but that they do so for different reasons. S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions are <emphasis effect="italics">disfavored</emphasis> in protic solvents because the <emphasis effect="italics">ground-state energy</emphasis> of the nucleophile is lowered by solvation. S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions are <emphasis effect="italics">favored</emphasis> in protic solvents because the <emphasis effect="italics">transition-state energy</emphasis> leading to carbocation intermediate is lowered by solvation.</para>
