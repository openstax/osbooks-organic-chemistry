    <para id="para-00001">Amides, like esters, are abundant in all living organisms. Proteins, nucleic acids, and many pharmaceutical agents have amide functional groups. The reason for this abundance of amides is that they are stable in the aqueous conditions found in living organisms. Amides are the least reactive of the common acid derivatives and undergo relatively few nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions.</para>

    <title>Conversion of Amides into Carboxylic Acids: Hydrolysis</title>
    <para id="para-00003">Amides undergo hydrolysis to yield carboxylic acids plus ammonia or an amine upon heating in either aqueous acid or aqueous base. The conditions required for amide hydrolysis are more extreme than those required for the hydrolysis of acid chlorides or esters, but the mechanisms are similar. Acidic hydrolysis reaction occurs by nucleophilic addition of water to the protonated amide, followed by transfer of a proton from oxygen to nitrogen to make the nitrogen a better leaving group, and subsequent elimination. The steps are reversible, with the equilibrium shifted toward product by protonation of NH<sub>3</sub> in the final step.</para>

    <para id="para-00004">Basic hydrolysis occurs by nucleophilic addition of OH<sup>–</sup> to the amide carbonyl group, followed by elimination of amide ion (<sup>–</sup>NH<sub>2</sub>) and subsequent deprotonation of the initially formed carboxylic acid by ammonia. The steps are reversible, with the equilibrium shifted toward product by the final deprotonation of the carboxylic acid. Basic hydrolysis is substantially more difficult than the analogous acid-catalyzed reaction because amide ion is a very poor leaving group, making the elimination step difficult.</para>

    <para id="para-00005">Amide hydrolysis is common in biological chemistry. Just as the hydrolysis of esters is the initial step in the digestion of dietary fats, the hydrolysis of amides is the initial step in the digestion of dietary proteins. The reaction is catalyzed by protease enzymes and occurs by a mechanism almost identical to what we just saw for fat hydrolysis. That is, an initial nucleophilic acyl substitution of an alcohol group in the enzyme on an amide linkage in the protein gives an acyl enzyme intermediate, which then undergoes hydrolysis.</para>

    <title>Conversion of Amides into Amines: Reduction</title>
