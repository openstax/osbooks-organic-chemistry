    <para id="para-00001">As we saw briefly in <link document="m00079">Section 6.6</link>, simple alkyl halides can sometimes be prepared by the radical reaction of an alkane with Cl<sub>2</sub> or Br<sub>2</sub> in the presence of ultraviolet light. The detailed mechanism is shown in <link target-id="fig-00001"/> for chlorination.</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows the following steps of a chlorination reaction: Initiation step Propagation steps (a repeating cycle) Termination steps and Overall reaction. In the initiation step a chlorine molecule reacts in the presence of hv to yield 2 chlorine radicals. Two arrows from the Cl-Cl bond point outward. Each chlorine radical shows an electron. The propagation includes steps 1 and 2. In the first step methane reacts with chlorine radical to yield HCl and a methyl radical that shows an electron. In the second step the methyl radical reacts with chlorine molecule to yield a chlorine radical and chloromethane. The termination includes three steps: Two methyl radicals react to yield ethane. A methyl radical reacts with a chlorine radical to yield chloromethane. Two chlorine radicals react to yield a chlorine molecule. The overall reaction shows a methane reacting with a chlorine molecule to yield chloromethane and HCl. The chlorine atoms are shown in pink.">

    <caption>Mechanism of the radical chlorination of methane. Three kinds of steps are required in radical substitution reactions: initiation, propagation, and termination. The propagation steps are a repeating cycle, with Cl<emphasis effect="bold">·</emphasis> a reactant in step 1 and a product in step 2, and with <emphasis effect="bold">·</emphasis>CH<sub>3</sub> a product in step 1 and a reactant in step 2. The symbol <emphasis effect="italics">hν</emphasis> shown in the initiation step is the standard way of indicating irradiation with light (<emphasis effect="italics">ν</emphasis> is the lowercase Greek letter nu).</caption>

    <para id="para-00002">Radical substitution reactions require three kinds of steps: <emphasis effect="italics">initiation, propagation</emphasis>, and <emphasis effect="italics">termination</emphasis>. Once an initiation step has started the process by producing radicals, the reaction continues in a self-sustaining cycle. The cycle requires two repeating propagation steps in which a radical, the halogen, and the alkane yield alkyl halide product plus more radical to carry on the chain. The chain is occasionally terminated by the combination of two radicals.</para>
    <para id="para-00003">Unfortunately, alkane halogenation is a poor synthetic method for preparing alkyl halides because mixtures of products invariably result. For example, chlorination of methane does not stop cleanly at the monochlorinated stage but continues to give a mixture of dichloro, trichloro, and even tetrachloro products.</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows four steps of a chlorination reaction. It shows methane reacting with a chlorine molecule in the presence of hv to yield chloromethane and HCl.

    <para id="para-00004">The situation is even worse for chlorination of alkanes that have more than one kind of hydrogen. Chlorination of butane, for instance, gives two monochlorinated products in a 30 : 70 ratio in addition to multiply chlorinated products such as dichlorobutane, trichlorobutane, and so on.</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows the reaction of butane and chlorine in the presence of light (hv) to yield 1-Chlorobutane and 2-Chlorobutane (30 : 70 ratio). Other products are Dichloro- trichloro- tetrachloro- and so on. Butane shows a methyl group bonded to a chain of two methylene groups and then a methyl group. 1-Chlorobutane shows a methyl group bonded to a chain of three methylene groups and then a chlorine. 2-Chlorobutane shows a methyl group bonded to a methylene group that is bonded to a methine group bonded to a methyl group; the methine group is bonded to a chlorine atom at the top. The chlorine atoms are highlighted.">

    <para id="para-00006">From these and similar reactions, it’s possible to calculate a reactivity order toward chlorination for different kinds of hydrogen atoms in a molecule. Take the butane chlorination, for instance. Butane has six equivalent primary hydrogens ( − CH<sub>3</sub>) and four equivalent secondary hydrogens ( − CH<sub>2</sub> − ). The fact that butane yields 30% of 1-chlorobutane product means that each one of the six primary hydrogens is responsible for 30% ÷ 6 = 5% of the product. Similarly, the fact that 70% of 2-chlorobutane is formed means that each of the four secondary hydrogens is responsible for 70% ÷ 4 = 17.5% of the product. Thus, a secondary hydrogen reacts 17.5% ÷ 5% = 3.5 times as often as a primary hydrogen.</para>
    <para id="para-00007">A similar calculation for the chlorination of 2-methylpropane indicates that each of the nine primary hydrogens accounts for 65% ÷ 9 = 7.2% of the product, while the single tertiary hydrogen (R<sub>3</sub>CH) accounts for 35% of the product. Thus, a tertiary hydrogen is 35% ÷ 7.2% = 5 times as reactive as a primary hydrogen toward chlorination.</para>
    <figure class="unnumbered scaled-down-30" id="fig-00005">
    <media alt="An illustration shows the reactivity of three groups in the following ascending order: Primary (1.0) secondary (3.5) and tertiary (5.0). The primary group shows a carbon bonded to three hydrogen atoms and an R group. The secondary group shows a carbon bonded to two hydrogen atoms and two R groups. The tertiary group shows a carbon bonded to a hydrogen and three R groups.">

    <para id="para-00008">The observed reactivity order of alkane hydrogens toward radical chlorination can be explained by looking at the bond dissociation energies given previously in Table 6-3. The data show that a tertiary C − H bond (400 kJ/mol; 96 kcal/mol) is weaker than a secondary C − H bond (410 kJ/mol; 98 kcal/mol), which is in turn weaker than a primary C − H bond (421 kJ/mol; 101 kcal/mol). Since less energy is needed to break a tertiary C − H bond than to break a primary or secondary C − H bond, the resultant tertiary radical is more stable than a primary or secondary radical.</para>
