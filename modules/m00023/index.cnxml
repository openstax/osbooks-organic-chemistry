    <para id="para-00001">Look back at the resonance forms of the acetate ion and the acetone anion shown in the previous section. The pattern seen there is a common one that leads to a useful technique for drawing resonance forms. In general, any three-atom grouping with a <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbital on each atom has two resonance forms:</para>
<figure class="unnumbered scaled-down" id="fig-00001">
<media alt="Two illustration images are shown here. The first illustration image shows 3 dumbbell shaped lobes labeled “X ” “Y” and “z” with the top lobe in pink and bottom lobe in blue. Pink lobes of “x” and “y” show a small dot and that of “Z” show an asterisk. The pink and blue lobes of “X” and “Y” are shown connected. The second illustration image shows 3 dumbbell shaped lobes labeled “X ” “Y” and “z” with the top lobe in pink and bottom lobe in blue. Pink lobes of “y” and “z” show a small dot and that of “x” show an asterisk. The pink and blue lobes of “y” and “z” are shown connected. In between these two images is a representation that shows a double bond between X and Y and a single bond between Y and Z with an asterisk. This shows a resonance form with a single bond between X and Y and a double bond between Y and Z. An asterisk is shown next to X. Double bonds in this representation are labeled “multiple bonds” and the asterisk is labeled “0 1 or 2 electrons.”">

<para id="para-00002">The atoms X, Y, and Z in the general structure might be C, N, O, P, S, or others, and the asterisk (*) might mean that the <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbital on atom Z is vacant, that it contains a single electron, or that it contains a lone pair of electrons. The two resonance forms differ simply by an exchange in position of the multiple bond and the asterisk from one end of the three-atom grouping to the other.</para>
<para id="para-00003">By learning to recognize such three-atom groupings within larger structures, resonance forms can be systematically generated. Look, for instance, at the anion produced when H<sup>+</sup> is removed from 2,4-pentanedione by reaction with a base. How many resonance structures does the resultant anion have?</para>
<figure class="unnumbered scaled-down-30" id="fig-00002">
<media alt="An illustration shows a molecular structure of “2, 4-Penanedione” with 3 carbon atoms having a single bond between them. The first and third carbon atoms are single bonded to methyl group and double bonded to an oxygen atom. The second carbon atom shares a single bond with 2 hydrogen atoms. The second illustration image shows the molecular structure that is the result of addition of base to 2 4-Penanedione. The second carbon atom becomes negatively charged and gains two electrons and is bonded to only one hydrogen atom.">

<para id="para-00004">The 2,4-pentanedione anion has a lone pair of electrons and a formal negative charge on the central carbon atom, next to a C=O bond on the left. The O=C–C<emphasis effect="bold">:</emphasis><sup>–</sup> grouping is a typical one for which two resonance structures can be drawn.</para>
<figure class="unnumbered scaled-down" id="fig-00003">
<media alt="An illustration shows two images with an established resonance form between them. The first illustration image shows a pair of electrons added to the oxygen atom in a 2 4-pentanedione anion and an addition of a pair of electrons from the third to the second carbon atom. The second illustration image shows the oxygen atom becoming negatively charged with 3 pairs of electrons and the bond is reduced to a single bond between the second carbon atom. A double bond is shown between the second and the third carbon atom. “Double bond” and “Lone pair of electrons” are shown in these illustration images.">

<para id="para-00005">Just as there is a C=O bond to the left of the lone pair, there is a second C=O bond to the right. Thus, we can draw a total of three resonance structures for the 2,4-pentanedione anion.</para>
<figure class="unnumbered scaled-down" id="fig-00004">
<media alt="An illustration shows 3 images that shows the resonance structures of the “2 4-pentanedione anion.” The first illustration image shows the addition of a pair of electrons to the oxygen atom from the second carbon atom and also release of a pair of electrons from the third carbon atom to the second. The second illustration image shows the release of a pair of electrons from the oxygen atom to the second carbon atom which in turn moves to the oxygen atom bonded to the third carbon atom. The third illustration image shows the line bond structure of 2 4-pentanedione anion where the first carbon atom is shown to have a double bond with an oxygen atom with 2 pairs of electrons; double bond between the second and third carbon atoms. The third carbon atom shares a single bond with a negatively charged oxygen atom with 3 pairs of electrons.">
