<para id="para-00001">One of the most striking features of the common fatty acids is that they have an even number of carbon atoms (<link document="m00265" target-id="table-00001"/>). This occurs because all fatty acids are derived biosynthetically from acetyl CoA by sequential addition of two-carbon units to a growing chain. The acetyl CoA, in turn, arises primarily from the metabolic breakdown of carbohydrates in the glycolysis pathway, which we’ll see in <link document="m00334"/>. Thus, dietary carbohydrates consumed in excess of immediate energy needs are turned into fats for storage.</para>
<para id="para-00002">As a general rule in biological chemistry, the anabolic pathway by which a substance is made is not the reverse of the catabolic pathway by which the same substance is degraded. The two paths must differ in some respects for both to be energetically favorable. Thus, the <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-oxidation pathway for converting fatty acids into acetyl CoA and the biosynthesis of fatty acids from acetyl CoA are related but are not exact opposites. Differences include the identity of the acyl-group carrier, the stereochemistry of the <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-hydroxyacyl reaction intermediate, and the identity of the redox coenzyme. FAD is used to introduce a double bond in <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-oxidation, while NADPH is used to reduce the double bond in fatty-acid biosynthesis.</para>
<para id="para-00003">In bacteria, each step in fatty-acid synthesis is catalyzed by a separate enzyme. In vertebrates, however, fatty-acid synthesis is catalyzed by an immense, multienzyme complex called a <emphasis effect="italics">synthase</emphasis> that contains two identical subunits of 2505 amino acids each and catalyzes all steps in the pathway. In fact, for an 18-carbon fatty acid, the synthase catalyzes 42 separate steps! An overview of fatty-acid biosynthesis is shown in <link target-id="fig-00001"/>.</para>

<para id="para-00004">The starting material for fatty-acid biosynthesis is the thioester acetyl CoA, the final product of carbohydrate breakdown, as we’ll see in <link document="m00335"/>. The pathway begins with several <emphasis effect="italics">priming reactions,</emphasis> which transport acetyl CoA and convert it into more reactive species. The first priming reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction that converts acetyl CoA into acetyl ACP (acyl carrier protein).</para>
<para id="para-00005">Notice that the mechanism of the nucleophilic acyl substitution in <emphasis effect="bold"><span class="magenta-text">step 1</span></emphasis> can be given in an abbreviated form that saves space by not explicitly showing the tetrahedral reaction intermediate. Instead, electron movement is shown as a heart-shaped path around the carbonyl oxygen to imply the two steps of the full mechanism. Biochemists commonly use this kind of abbreviated format, and we’ll also use it on occasion through the rest of this chapter.</para>

<title>MECHANISM</title>
<media alt="An illustration involves eight steps involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. Step “1” reads: an acetyl group is transferred from CoA to ACP (acyl carrier protein).” Acetyl CoA shows a carbonyl group (oxygen highlighted in pink) bonded to a methyl group on the left and green SCoA on the right; acetyl CoA undergoes a pathway that is divided into two parts “1” “2” on left and “3” “4” on right. A reaction arrow “1” on the left indicating conversion of blue HSACP to green HSCoA shows formation of acetyl ACP having a methyl group bonded to a carbonyl group (pink O) whose carbon is bonded to blue SACP. Step “2” reads: the acetyl group is transferred again from ACP to a synthase enzyme. A reaction arrow “2” indicating conversion of green Hs-Synthase to blue HSACP shows formation of acetyl synthase having a carbonyl group (pink O) bonded to a methyl group on left and green S-Synthase on right. Step “3” mentioned on the right reads: acetyl CoA is carboxylated to give malonyl CoA. A reaction arrow “3” indicates conversion of pink carbonic acid ATP to ADP (highlighted in blue) inorganic phosphate and proton; the reaction shows formation of malonyl CoA having an oxygen highlighted in pink anion bonded to a pink carbonyl group bonded to methylene group bonded to a carbonyl group bonded to green SCoA. Step “4” below reads: the malonyl group is transferred from CoA to ACP. A reaction arrow “4” indicating conversion of blue HSACP to green HSCoA shows formation of malonyl ACP having an oxygen highlighted in pink anion bonded to a pink carbonyl group bonded to methylene group bonded to a carbonyl group bonded to blue SCoA. Both products of step “2” and step “4” converge to undergo step “5.” Step “5” reads: Claisen-like condensation of malonyl ACP with acetyl synthase occurs followed by decarboxylation to yield acetoacetyl ACP a beta-keto thioester. A reaction arrow “5” indicating exemption of green S anion bonded to synthase and carbon dioxide highlighted in pink leads to formation of acetoacetyl ACP having a methyl group bonded to a carbonyl group (pink O) bonded to methylene group bonded to a carbonyl (pink O) whose carbon is bonded to blue SACP. Step “6” reads: reduction of the ketone by NADPH yields the corresponding beta-hydroxy thioester. A reaction arrow “6” indicating conversion of blue NADPH/H plus to pink NADP cation forms beta-hydroxybutyryl ACP having a methyl group bonded to a methine (blue H) bonded to a pink hydroxyl group at the top the methine is bonded to methylene group bonded to a carbonyl (pink O) whose carbon is bonded to blue SACP. Step “7” reads: dehydration of beta-hydroxybutyryl ADP gives crotonyl ACP an alpha beta-unsaturated thioester. A reaction arrow “7” indicating loss of water molecule highlighted in pink shows formation of Crotonyl ACP having a methyl group bonded to a methine group double bonded (pink) to another methine bonded to a carbonyl group (pink O) whose carbon is bonded to blue SACP. Step “8” reads: reduction of the double bond yields the saturated chain-elongated butyryl ACP. The reaction arrow “8” indicating conversion of blue NADPH/H plus to pink NADP cation leads to formation of butyryl ACP having a methyl group bonded to two methylene groups bonded to a carbonyl group (pink O) bonded to blue SACP.">

<para id="para-00006">In bacteria, ACP is a small protein of 77 residues that transports an acyl group from one enzyme to another. In vertebrates, however, ACP appears to be a long arm on a multienzyme synthase complex, whose apparent function is to shepherd an acyl group from site to site within the complex. As in acetyl CoA, the acyl group in acetyl ACP is linked by a thioester bond to the sulfur atom of phosphopantetheine. The phosphopantetheine is in turn linked to ACP through the side-chain  –OH group of a serine residue in the enzyme.</para>
