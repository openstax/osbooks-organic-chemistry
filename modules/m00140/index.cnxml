    <para id="para-00001">In <term id="term-00001">infrared (IR) spectroscopy</term>, the IR region of the electromagnetic spectrum covers the range from just above the visible (7.8 × 10<sup>–7</sup> m) to approximately 10<sup>–4</sup> m, but only the midportion from 2.5 × 10<sup>–6</sup> m to 2.5 × 10<sup>–5</sup> m is used by organic chemists (<link target-id="fig-00001"/>. Wavelengths within the IR region are usually given in micrometers (1 <emphasis effect="italics">μ</emphasis>m = 10<sup>–6</sup> m), and frequencies are given in wavenumbers rather than in hertz. The <term id="term-00002">wavenumber <m:math><m:mover accent="true"><m:mi>v</m:mi><m:mo>˜</m:mo></m:mover></m:math></term> is the reciprocal of wavelength in centimeters and is therefore expressed in units of cm<sup>–1</sup>.</para>

    <media alt="An illustration shows the electromagnetic spectrum with six unequal divisions; their wavelengths are shown in “lambda (cm)” at the base of spectrum; above the spectrum is shown a left arrow labeled as “energy.” The spectrum starts with ultraviolet region with wavelength of 10 to the power minus five followed by a visible spectrum followed by near infrared region having wavelength 10 to the power minus four; the next spectrum is infrared having the wavelength 10 to the power minus three followed by far infrared having wavelength 10 to the power minus two followed by microwaves region having wavelength 10 to the power minus one. The left side boundary of infrared is labeled as “lambda equal to 2.5 x 10 to the power minus 4 cm equal to 2.5 micrometer; nu bar equal to 4000 cm to the power minus 1”; the right side boundary of infrared spectrum shows “lambda equal to 2.5 x 10 to the power minus three cm equal to 25 micrometers; nu bar equal to 400 cm to the power minus one.”">

    <para id="para-00003">Why does an organic molecule absorb some wavelengths of IR radiation but not others? All molecules have a certain amount of energy and are in constant motion. Their bonds stretch and contract, atoms wag back and forth, and other molecular vibrations occur. Some of the kinds of allowed vibrations are shown below:</para>
    <figure class="unnumbered" id="fig-00002">
    <media alt="An illustration shows four types of stretching and bending in bonds through ball-and-stick models. Gray balls represent carbon atoms and white balls represent hydrogen atoms. In all the structures a carbon is bonded to two hydrogen atoms at the bottom a hydrogen at the top right and a hydrogen at the top left. In the first structure labeled “symmetric stretching” two blurred hydrogens are shown on both sides of the top hydrogen atoms in a slanting row. Two double-headed arrows represent the stretching. In the second structure labeled “antisymmetric stretching” another blurred carbon is shown next to the central carbon. The blurred carbon is bonded to a blurred hydrogen at the top left and a blurred hydrogen at the top right; both blurred hydrogens are shown next to the normal hydrogens. Two double-headed arrows are shown above the hydrogens on both the sides and a third arrow is shown over the blurred carbon. In the third structure labeled “in-plane bending” two blurred hydrogens are shown on both sides of the top hydrogen atoms. Two double-headed arrows represent the clockwise and counterclockwise bending. In the fourth structure labeled “out-of-plane bending” two blurred hydrogens are shown on the sides of the bottom hydrogen atoms. Two double-headed arrows represent the inward and outward bending on the sides.">

    <para id="para-00004">The amount of energy a molecule contains is not continuously variable but is <emphasis effect="italics">quantized.</emphasis> That is, a molecule can stretch or bend only at specific frequencies corresponding to specific energy levels. Take bond stretching, for example. Although we usually speak of bond lengths as if they were fixed, the numbers given are really averages. In fact, a typical C – H bond with an average bond length of 110 pm is actually vibrating at a specific frequency, alternately stretching and contracting as if there were a spring connecting the two atoms.</para>
    <para id="para-00005">When a molecule is irradiated with electromagnetic radiation, energy is absorbed if the frequency of the radiation matches the frequency of the vibration. The result of this energy absorption is an increased amplitude for the vibration; in other words, the “spring” connecting the two atoms stretches and compresses a bit further. Since each frequency absorbed by a molecule corresponds to a specific molecular motion, we can find what kinds of motions a molecule has by measuring its IR spectrum. By interpreting these motions, we can find out what kinds of bonds (functional groups) are present in the molecule.</para>
