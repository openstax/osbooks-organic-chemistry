<para id="para-00001">The fatty acids that result from triacylglycerol hydrolysis are converted into thioesters with coenzyme A and then catabolized by a repetitive four-step sequence of reactions called the <term id="term-00001"><emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-oxidation pathway</term>, shown in <link target-id="fig-00001"/>. Each passage along the pathway results in the cleavage of an acetyl group from the end of the fatty-acid chain, until the entire molecule is ultimately degraded. As each acetyl group is produced, it enters the citric acid cycle and is further degraded to CO<sub>2</sub>, as we’ll see in <link document="m00336"/>.</para>

<title>Step <span class="magenta-text">1</span> of <link target-id="fig-00001"/>: Introduction of a Double Bond</title>
<para id="para-00002">The <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-oxidation pathway begins when two hydrogen atoms are removed from C2 and C3 of the fatty acyl CoA by one of a family of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases to yield an <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis>,<emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-unsaturated acyl CoA. This kind of oxidation—the introduction of a conjugated double bond into a carbonyl compound—occurs frequently in biochemical pathways and usually involves the coenzyme flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Reduced FADH<sub>2</sub> is the by-product.</para>

<para id="para-00003">The mechanisms of FAD-catalyzed reactions are often difficult to establish because flavin coenzymes can follow both two-electron (polar) and one-electron (radical) pathways. As a result, extensive studies of the family of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases have not yet provided a clear picture of how these enzymes function. What is known is that: (<emphasis effect="bold"><span class="magenta-text">1</span></emphasis>) The first step is abstraction of the pro-<emphasis effect="italics">R</emphasis> hydrogen from the acidic <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis> position of the acyl CoA to give a thioester enolate ion. Hydrogen-bonding between the acyl carbonyl group and the ribitol hydroxyls of FAD increases the acidity of the acyl group. (<emphasis effect="bold"><span class="magenta-text">2</span></emphasis>) The pro-<emphasis effect="italics">R</emphasis> hydrogen at the <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis> position is transferred to FAD. (<emphasis effect="bold"><span class="magenta-text">3</span></emphasis>) The <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis>,<emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-unsaturated acyl CoA that results has a trans double bond.</para>

<para id="para-00004">One suggested mechanism has the reaction taking place by a conjugate nucleophilic addition of hydride, analogous to what occurs during alcohol oxidations with NAD<sup>+</sup>.

Protonation of the intermediate at N1 would give the product.</para>

<para id="para-00007">Acetyl CoA is split off from the chain in the final step of <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-oxidation, leaving an acyl CoA that is two carbon atoms shorter than the original. The reaction is catalyzed by <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase and is mechanistically the reverse of a Claisen condensation reaction (<link document="m00282"/>). In the forward direction, a Claisen condensation joins two esters together to form a <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-keto ester product.

<para id="para-00008">The retro-Claisen reaction occurs by nucleophilic addition of a cysteine  −SH group on the enzyme to the keto group of the <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-ketoacyl CoA to yield an alkoxide ion intermediate. Cleavage of the C2–C3 bond then follows, with the expulsion of an acetyl CoA enolate ion that is immediately protonated. The enzyme-bound acyl group then undergoes nucleophilic acyl substitution by reaction with a molecule of coenzyme A, and the chain-shortened acyl CoA that results re-enters the <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-oxidation pathway for further degradation.</para>

<para id="para-00010">Most fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, so none are left over after <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-oxidation.
