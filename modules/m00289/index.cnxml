<para id="para-00001">Amines can be either alkyl-substituted (<term id="term-00001">alkylamines</term>) or aryl-substituted (<term id="term-00002">arylamines</term>). Although much of the chemistry of the two classes is similar, there are also substantial differences. Amines are classified as <term id="term-00003">primary (RNH<sub>2</sub>)</term>, <term id="term-00004">secondary (R<sub>2</sub>NH)</term>, or <term id="term-00005">tertiary (R<sub>3</sub>N)</term>, depending on the number of organic substituents attached to nitrogen. Thus, methylamine (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>) is a primary amine, dimethylamine [(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NH] is a secondary amine, and trimethylamine [(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>N] is a tertiary amine. Note that this usage of the terms <emphasis effect="italics">primary, secondary,</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">tertiary</emphasis> differs from our previous usage. When we speak of a tertiary alcohol or alkyl halide, we refer to the degree of substitution at the alkyl carbon atom, but when we speak of a tertiary amine, we refer to the degree of substitution at the nitrogen atom.</para>

<para id="para-00003">Primary amines are named in the IUPAC system in several ways. For simple amines, the suffix -<emphasis effect="italics">amine</emphasis> is added to the name of the alkyl substituent. You might also recall from the chapter on <link document="m00180">Benzene and Aromaticity</link> that the aromatic phenylamine, H<sub>2</sub>N–C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, has the common name <emphasis effect="italics">aniline.</emphasis></para>
