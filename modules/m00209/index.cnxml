      <title>Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution Reactions</title>
      <para id="para-00001">The hydroxyl group is a strongly activating, ortho- and para-directing substituent in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions (<link document="m00192"/>). As a result, phenols are highly reactive substrates for electrophilic halogenation, nitration, sulfonation, and Friedel–Crafts reactions.</para>

      <title>Oxidation of Phenols: Quinones</title>
      <para id="para-00002">Phenols don’t undergo oxidation in the same way as alcohols because they don’t have a hydrogen atom on the hydroxyl-bearing carbon. Instead, oxidation of a phenol yields a 2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-dione, or <term id="term-00001">quinone</term>. Many different oxidizing agents will accomplish the transformation, with Na<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> as a common choice for simple phenols and potassium nitrosodisulfonate [(KSO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NO], called Fremy’s salt, is often used.</para>

Ubiquinones, also called <emphasis effect="italics">coenzymes Q,</emphasis> are components of the cells in all aerobic organisms, from the simplest bacterium to humans. They are so named because of their ubiquitous occurrence throughout nature.</para>

      <para id="para-00005">Ubiquinones function within the mitochondria of cells to mediate the respiration process in which electrons are transported from the biological reducing agent NADH to molecular oxygen. Through a complex series of steps, the ultimate result is a cycle whereby NADH is oxidized to NAD<sup>+</sup>, O<sub>2</sub> is reduced to water, and energy is produced. Ubiquinone acts only as an intermediary and is itself unchanged.</para>
