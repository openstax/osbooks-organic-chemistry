<title>Electrophilic Aromatic Substitutions</title>
<para id="para-00001">An amino group is strongly activating and ortho- and para-directing in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions (<link document="m00192"/>). This high reactivity of amino-substituted benzenes can be a drawback at times because it’s often difficult to prevent polysubstitution. Reaction of aniline with Br<sub>2</sub>, for instance, takes place rapidly and yields the 2,4,6-tribrominated product. The amino group is so strongly activating that it’s not possible to stop at the monobromo stage.</para>
<figure class="unnumbered scaled-down" id="fig-00001">
<media alt="An illustration shows a reaction in which Aniline reacts in the presence of 3 moles of bromine (pink) and water to yield 2 4 6-Tribromoaniline (100%).

<para id="para-00002">Another drawback to the use of amino-substituted benzenes in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions is that Friedel–Crafts reactions are not successful (<link document="m00191"/>). The amino group forms an acid–base complex with the AlCl<sub>3</sub> catalyst, which prevents further reaction. Both drawbacks can be overcome, however, by carrying out electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions on the corresponding amide rather than on the free amine.</para>
<para id="para-00003">As we saw in <link document="m00243"/>, treatment of an amine with acetic anhydride yields the corresponding acetyl amide, or acetamide. Although still activating and ortho-, para-directing, amido substituents (<m:math><m:mrow><m:mtext>R–N–C=O</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math>) are less strongly activating and less basic than amino groups because their nitrogen lone-pair electrons are delocalized by the neighboring carbonyl group. As a result, bromination of an <emphasis effect="italics">N</emphasis>-arylamide occurs cleanly to give a monobromo product, and hydrolysis of the amide with aqueous base then gives the free amine. For example, <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis>-toluidine (4-methylaniline) can be acetylated, brominated, and hydrolyzed to yield 2-bromo-4-methylaniline. None of the 2,6-dibrominated product is obtained.</para>
<figure class="unnumbered scaled-down" id="fig-00002">
<media alt="An illustration shows a reaction in which p-toluidine reacts with green (CH3CO)2O and Pyridine to yield an intermediate that reacts with pink bromine to yield a second intermediate that reacts with NaOH and H2O to yield 2-bromo-4-methylaniline (79%) and green acetate ion. p-Toluidine shows benzene with C1 bonded to blue amino group and C4 bonded to a methyl group. The first intermediate shows benzene with C1 bonded to blue nitrogen monohydride bonded to green carbonyl group bonded to green methyl group. C4 is bonded to a methyl group. The second intermediate is similar to the first intermediate but C2 is bonded to pink bromine. 2-bromo-4-methylaniline shows benzene with C1 bonded to blue amino group C2 bonded to a pink bromine C4 bonded to a methyl group.">

<para id="para-00005">Moderating the reactivity of an amino-substituted benzene by forming an amide is a useful trick that allows many kinds of electrophilic aromatic substitutions to be carried out that would otherwise be impossible. One example is the preparation of the sulfa drugs, such as sulfanilamide.</para>
<para id="para-00006">Sulfa drugs were among the first pharmaceutical agents to be used clinically against bacterial infection. Although they have largely been replaced today by safer and more powerful antibiotics, sulfa drugs are credited with saving the lives of thousands of wounded during World War II and are still prescribed for urinary tract infections. They are prepared by chlorosulfonation of acetanilide, followed by reaction of <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis>-(<emphasis effect="italics">N</emphasis>-acetylamino)benzenesulfonyl chloride with ammonia or some other amine to give a sulfonamide. Hydrolysis of the amide then yields the sulfa drug. Note that hydrolysis of the amide can be carried out in the presence of the sulfonamide group because sulfonamides hydrolyze very slowly.</para>
