  "taskDescription": "<p>Evidence that cleavage of 1,2-diols by HIO<sub>4</sub> occurs through a five-membered cyclic periodate intermediate is based on the measurement of reaction rates. When diols <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> were prepared and the rates of their reaction with HIO<sub>4</sub> were measured, it was found that diol <b>A</b> cleaved approximately 1 million times faster than diol <b>B</b>. Make molecular models of <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> and of potential cyclic periodate intermediates, and then explain the results.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_08_EC_049.jpg\" alt=\"Structure A (cis diol) shows bicyclic heptane with hydroxyls at the top of C2 and C3.
