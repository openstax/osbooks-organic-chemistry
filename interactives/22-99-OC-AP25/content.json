  "taskDescription": "<p>Attempted Grignard reaction of cyclohexanone with <i>tert</i>-butylmagnesium bromide yields only about 1% of the expected addition product along with 99% unreacted cyclohexanone. If D<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> is added to the reaction mixture after a suitable period, however, the &#8220;unreacted&#8221; cyclohexanone is found to have one deuterium atom incorporated into it.
