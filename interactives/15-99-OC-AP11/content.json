  "taskDescription": "<p>In 1932, A. A. Levine and A. G. Cole studied the ozonolysis of <i>o</i>-xylene and isolated three products: glyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, and pyruvaldehyde:</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_15_EC_009.jpg\" alt=\"Benzene with methyl groups at C 1 and C 2 reacts with ozone in the presence of zinc to form glyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, and pyruvaldehyde.\">\n<p>In what ratio would you expect the three products to be formed if <i>o</i>-xylene is a resonance hybrid of two structures? The actual ratio found was 3 parts glyoxal, 1 part 2,3-butanedione, and 2 parts pyruvaldehyde. What conclusions can you draw about the structure of <i>o</i>-xylene?</p>",
