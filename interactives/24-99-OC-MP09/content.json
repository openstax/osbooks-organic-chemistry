  "taskDescription": "<p>Chlorophyll, heme, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, and a host of other substances are biosynthesized from porphobilinogen (PBG), which is itself formed from condensation of two molecules of 5-aminolevulinate. The two 5-aminolevulinates are bound to lysine (Lys) amino acids in the enzyme, one in the enamine form and one in the imine form, and their condensation is thought to occur by the following steps. Use curved arrows to show the mechanism of each step.</p>\n<img src=\"media/OChem_24_EC_024.jpg\" alt=\"Two molecules of enzyme-bound 5-aminolevulinate react to produce four intermediates. This further leads to the final product named Porphobilinogen (P B G).\">",
