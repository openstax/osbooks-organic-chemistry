  "taskDescription": "<p>One of the biological pathways by which an amine is converted to a ketone involves two steps: (<b><span class=\"magenta-text\">1</span></b>) oxidation of the amine by NAD<sup>+</sup> to give an imine and (<b><span class=\"magenta-text\">2</span></b>) hydrolysis of the imine to give a ketone plus ammonia. Glutamate, for instance, is converted by this process into <i>&#945;</i>-ketoglutarate. Show the structure of the imine intermediate, and propose mechanisms for both steps.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_19_EC_040.jpg\" alt=\"The reaction shows the conversion of glutamate with N A D plus to form an imine, which yields alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia on reaction with water.\">",
