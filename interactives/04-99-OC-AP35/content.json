In formulating your answer, draw the more stable chair conformations of all four stereoisomers and the product ketal for each one.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OSX_OrgChem_04_99_ketal_img.jpg\" alt=\"In a reaction, 1R,3R,4S)-4-tertiary-butyl-1,3-cyclohexanediol reacts with acetone in the presence of acid catalyst to form an acetal (no change in stereochemistry) and water.\">",
