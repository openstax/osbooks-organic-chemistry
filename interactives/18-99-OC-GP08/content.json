  "taskDescription": "<p>Disparlure, C<sub>19</sub>H<sub>38</sub>O, is a sex attractant released by the female spongy moth, <i>Lymantria dispar.</i> The <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of disparlure shows a large absorption in the alkane region, 1 to 2 <i>&#948;,</i> and a triplet at 2.8 <i>&#948;.</i> Treatment of disparlure, first with aqueous acid and then with KMnO<sub>4</sub>, yields two carboxylic acids identified as undecanoic acid and 6-methylheptanoic acid. (KMnO<sub>4</sub> cleaves 1,2-diols to yield carboxylic acids.) Neglecting stereochemistry, propose a structure for disparlure. The actual compound is a chiral molecule with 7<i>R</i>,8<i>S</i> stereochemistry. Draw disparlure, showing the correct stereochemistry.</p>",
