  "taskDescription": "<p>The aconitase-catalyzed addition of water to <i>cis</i>-aconitate in the citric acid cycle occurs with the following stereochemistry. Does the addition of the OH group occur on the Re or Si face of the substrate? What about the addition of the H? Do the H and OH groups add from the same side of the double bond or from opposite sides?</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_05_11_011.jpg\" alt=\"The figure shows a reaction where cis-aconitate reacts with water in the presence of aconitase to form (2 R, 3 S)-isocitrate.\">",
