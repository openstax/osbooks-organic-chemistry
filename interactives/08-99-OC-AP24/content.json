  "taskDescription": "<p>Compound <b>A</b> has the formula C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>. It reacts rapidly with KMnO<sub>4</sub> to give CO<sub>2</sub> and a carboxylic acid, <b>B</b> (C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), but reacts with only 1 molar equivalent of H<sub>2</sub> on catalytic hydrogenation over a palladium catalyst. On hydrogenation under conditions that reduce aromatic rings, 4 equivalents of H<sub>2</sub> are taken up and hydrocarbon <b>C</b> (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>16</sub>) is produced. What are the structures of <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>C</b>? Write the reactions.</p>",
