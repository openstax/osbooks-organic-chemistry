  "taskDescription": "<p>One way to determine the number of acidic hydrogens in a molecule is to treat the compound with NaOD in D<sub>2</sub>O, isolate the product, and determine its molecular weight by mass spectrometry. For example, if cyclohexanone is treated with NaOD in D<sub>2</sub>O, the product has MW = 102. Explain how this method works.</p>",
