  "taskDescription": "<p>Amines are converted into alkenes by a two-step process called the Hofmann elimination. S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction of the amine with an excess of CH<sub>3</sub>I in the first step yields an intermediate that undergoes E2 reaction when treated with silver oxide as base. Pentylamine, for example, yields 1-pentene. Propose a structure for the intermediate, and explain why it readily undergoes elimination.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_11_EC_048.jpg\" alt=\"A reaction of 1-aminopentane first with excess methyl iodide and then with Ag 2 O and water yields 1-pentene.\">",
