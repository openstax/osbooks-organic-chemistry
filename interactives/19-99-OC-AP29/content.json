  "taskDescription": "<p>The <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum shown is that of a compound isomeric with the one in Problem 19-80. This isomer has an IR absorption at 1730 cm<sup>&#8211;1</sup>. Propose a structure. [<i>Note:</i> Aldehyde protons (CHO) often show low coupling constants to adjacent hydrogens, so the splitting of aldehyde signals is not always apparent.]</p>\n<img src=\"media/OChem_19_EC_061.jpg\" alt=\"Proton spectrum shows shifts of 0 (T M S), 2.75 (triplet), 2.95 (triplet), 7.23 and 7.31 (multiplet), and 9.82 (singlet).
