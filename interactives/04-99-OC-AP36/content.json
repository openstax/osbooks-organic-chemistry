  "taskDescription": "<p>Alcohols undergo an <i>oxidation</i> reaction to yield carbonyl compounds when treatment with CrO<sub>3</sub>. For example, 2-<i>tert</i>-butylcyclohexanol gives 2-<i>tert</i>-butylcyclohexanone. If axial &#8722;OH groups are generally more reactive than their equatorial isomers, which do you think reacts faster, the cis isomer of 2-<i>tert</i>-butylcyclohexanol or the trans isomer?
