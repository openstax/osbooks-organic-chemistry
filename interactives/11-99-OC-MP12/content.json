  "taskDescription": "<p>Methyl esters (RCO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>) undergo a cleavage reaction to yield carboxylate ions plus iodomethane on heating with LiI in dimethylformamide:</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_11_EC_021.jpg\" alt=\"The reaction of methyl cyclohexanoate with lithium iodide in dimethylformamide forms lithium cyclohexanoate and methyl iodide.\">\n<p>The following evidence has been obtained: (1) The reaction occurs much faster in DMF than in ethanol. (2) The corresponding ethyl ester (RCO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>) cleaves approximately 10 times more slowly than the methyl ester. Propose a mechanism for the reaction. What other kinds of experimental evidence could you gather to support your hypothesis?</p>",
