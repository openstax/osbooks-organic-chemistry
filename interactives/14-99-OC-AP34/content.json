  "taskDescription": "<p>Myrcene, C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>, is found in oil of bay leaves and is isomeric with <i>&#946;</i>-ocimene (Problem 14-49). It has an ultraviolet absorption at 226 nm and can be hydrogenated to yield 2,6-dimethyloctane. On ozonolysis followed by zinc/acetic acid treatment, myrcene yields formaldehyde, acetone, and 2-oxopentanedial:</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_14_EC_031.jpg\" alt=\"The condensed structure of 2-oxopentanedial has a 5-carbon chain. C 1, C 2, and C 5 are each double-bonded to an oxygen atom.\">\n<p>Propose a structure for myrcene, and write the reactions, showing starting material and products.</p>",
