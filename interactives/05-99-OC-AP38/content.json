  "taskDescription": "<p><i>Allenes</i> are compounds with adjacent carbon&#8211;carbon double bonds. Many allenes are chiral, even though they don&#8217;t contain chirality centers. Mycomycin, for example, a naturally occurring antibiotic isolated from the bacterium <i>Nocardia acidophilus,</i> is chiral and has [<i>&#945;</i>]<sub>D</sub> = &#8722;130. Explain why mycomycin is chiral.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_05_EC_029.jpg\" alt=\"The condensed structural formula of mycomycin.\">",
