  "taskDescription": "<p>Aromatic compounds such as benzene react with alkyl chlorides in the presence of AlCl<sub>3</sub> catalyst to yield alkylbenzenes. This reaction occurs through a carbocation intermediate, formed by reaction of the alkyl chloride with AlCl<sub>3</sub> (R&#8722;Cl + AlCl<sub>3</sub> &#10230; R<sup>+</sup> + AlCl<sub>4</sub><sup>&#8722;</sup>). How can you explain the observation that reaction of benzene with 1-chloropropane yields isopropylbenzene as the major product?</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_07_EC_036.jpg\" alt=\"Benzene reacts with propyl chloride in the presence of aluminum trichloride to form a benzene ring, in which C1 is bonded to an isopropyl group.\">",
