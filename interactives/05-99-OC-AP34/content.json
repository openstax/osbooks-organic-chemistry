  "taskDescription": "<p>The naturally occurring form of the amino acid cysteine (Problem 5-63) has the <i>R</i> configuration at its chirality center. On treatment with a mild oxidizing agent, two cysteines join to give cystine, a disulfide. Assuming that the chirality center is not affected by the reaction, is cystine optically active? Explain.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_05_EC_026.jpg\" alt=\"The figure shows a reaction where two molecules of cysteine convert to cystine.\">",
