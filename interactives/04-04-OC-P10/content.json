  "taskDescription": "<p>How many H&#8201;&#10231;&#8201;H eclipsing interactions would be present if cyclopentane were planar? Assuming an energy cost of 4.0 kJ/mol for each eclipsing interaction, how much torsional strain would planar cyclopentane have? Since the measured total strain of cyclopentane is 26 kJ/mol, how much of the torsional strain is relieved by puckering?</p>",
