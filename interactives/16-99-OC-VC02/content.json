  "taskDescription": "<p>The following molecular model of a dimethyl-substituted biphenyl represents the lowest-energy conformation of the molecule. Why are the two benzene rings tilted at a 63&#176; angle to each other rather than being in the same plane so that their <i>p</i> orbitals overlap? Why doesn&#8217;t complete rotation around the single bond joining the two rings occur?</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down-30\" src=\"media/OChem_16_EC_018.jpg\" alt=\"The ball-and-stick model has two benzene rings bonded to each other. Each benzene ring also has an ortho methyl group.\">",
