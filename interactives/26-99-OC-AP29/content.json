  "taskDescription": "<p>Oxytocin, a nonapeptide hormone secreted by the pituitary gland, functions by stimulating uterine contraction and lactation during childbirth. Its sequence was determined from the following evidence:</p>\n<p><b>1.</b> Oxytocin is a cyclic compound containing a disulfide bridge between two cysteine residues.</p>\n<p><b>2.</b> When the disulfide bridge is reduced, oxytocin has the constitution Asn, Cys<sub>2</sub>, Gln, Gly, Ile, Leu, Pro, Tyr.</p>\n<p><b>3.</b> Partial hydrolysis of reduced oxytocin yields seven fragments: Asp-Cys, Ile-Glu, Cys-Tyr, Leu-Gly, Tyr-Ile-Glu, Glu-Asp-Cys, and Cys-Pro-Leu.</p>\n<p><b>4.</b> Gly is the C-terminal group.</p>\n<p><b>5.</b> Both Glu and Asp are present as their side-chain amides (Gln and Asn) rather than as free side-chain acids.</p>\n<p>What is the amino acid sequence of reduced oxytocin? What is the structure of oxytocin itself?</p>",
