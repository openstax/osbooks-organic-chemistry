  "taskDescription": "<small style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">L</small>-Gulose can be prepared from <small style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">D</small>-glucose by a route that begins with oxidation to <small style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">D</small>-glucaric acid, which cyclizes to form two six-membered-ring lactones. Separating the lactones and reducing them with sodium amalgam gives <small style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">D</small>-glucose and <small style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">L</small>-gulose. What are the structures of the two lactones, and which one is reduced to <small style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">L</small>-gulose?",
