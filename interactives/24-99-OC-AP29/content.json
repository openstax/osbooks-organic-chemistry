  "taskDescription": "<p>Atropine, C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>23</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>, is a poisonous alkaloid isolated from the leaves and roots of <i>Atropa belladonna,</i> the deadly nightshade. In small doses, atropine acts as a muscle relaxant; 0.5 ng (nanogram, 10<sup>&#8211;9</sup> g) is sufficient to cause pupil dilation. On basic hydrolysis, atropine yields tropic acid, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH(CH<sub>2</sub>OH)CO<sub>2</sub>H, and tropine, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>15</sub>NO. Tropine is an optically inactive alcohol that yields tropidene on dehydration with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Propose a structure for atropine.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down-30\" src=\"media/OChem_24_EC_051.jpg\" alt=\"The structure of tropidene, a bicyclic compound incorporating a nitrogen with a methyl substituent.\">",
