  "taskDescription": "<p>Luminol, which is used by forensic scientists to find blood, fluoresces as a result of Diels&#8211;Alder-like process. The dianion of luminol reacts with O<sub>2</sub> to form an unstable peroxide intermediate that then loses nitrogen to form a dicarboxylate and emit light. The process is similar to that in Problems 14-21 and 14-22. Propose a mechanism for this process.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_14_EC_010.jpg\" alt=\"Luminol dianion reacts with molecular oxygen to yield aniline with carboxylate groups bonded at positions 2 and 3. Molecular nitrogen is a byproduct and light is generated.\">",
