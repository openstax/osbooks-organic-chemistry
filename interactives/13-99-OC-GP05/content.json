  "taskDescription": "<p>Long-range coupling between protons more than two carbon atoms apart is sometimes observed when <i>&#960;</i> bonds intervene. An example is found in 1-methoxy-1-buten-3-yne. Not only does the acetylenic proton, H<i><sub>a</sub></i>, couple with the vinylic proton H<i><sub>b</sub></i>, it also couples with the vinylic proton H<i><sub>c</sub></i>, four carbon atoms away. The data are:</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_13_EC_019.jpg\" alt=\"1-Methoxy-1-buten-3-yne structure with hydrogen shifts of 3.08 (alkyne). 4.52 (on C 2), and 6.35 (on C 1).
