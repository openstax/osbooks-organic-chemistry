  "taskDescription": "<p>The amino acid methionine is formed by a methylation reaction of homocysteine with <i>N</i>-methyltetrahydrofolate. The stereochemistry of the reaction has been probed by carrying out the transformation using a donor with a &#8220;chiral methyl group,&#8221; which contains protium (H), deuterium (D), and tritium (T) isotopes of hydrogen. Does the methylation reaction occur with inversion or retention of configuration?</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_11_EC_047.jpg\" alt=\"The reaction of homocysteine in the presence of methionine synthase forms methionine, N-methyltetrahydrofolate, and Tetrahydrofolate.\">",
