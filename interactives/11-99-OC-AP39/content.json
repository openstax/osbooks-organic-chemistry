  "taskDescription": "<p>Compound <b>X</b> is optically inactive and has the formula C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>16</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>. On treatment with strong base, <b>X</b> gives hydrocarbon <b>Y</b>, C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>14</sub>. Compound <b>Y</b> absorbs 2 equivalents of hydrogen when reduced over a palladium catalyst and reacts with ozone to give two fragments. One fragment, <b>Z</b>, is an aldehyde with formula C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O. The other fragment is glyoxal, (CHO)<sub>2</sub>. Write the reactions involved, and suggest structures for <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, and <b>Z</b>. What is the stereochemistry of <b>X</b>?</p>",
