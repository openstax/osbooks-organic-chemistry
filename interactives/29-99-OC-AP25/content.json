  "taskDescription": "<p>In step 8 of fatty-acid biosynthesis (Figure 29.6), reduction of <i>trans</i>-crotonyl ACP gives butyryl ACP. A hydride from NADPH adds to C3 of the crotonyl group from the Re face, and protonation on C2 occurs on the Si face. Is the reduction a syn addition or an anti addition?</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_29_EC_021.jpg\" alt=\"trans-Crotonyl ACP reacts to form butyryl A C P.
