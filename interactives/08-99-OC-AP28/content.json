  "taskDescription": "<p>Reaction of HBr with 3-methylcyclohexene yields a mixture of four products: <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans-</i>1-bromo-3-methylcyclohexane and <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans</i>-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The analogous reaction of HBr with 3-bromocyclohexene yields <i>trans</i>-1,2-dibromocyclohexane as the sole product. Draw structures of the possible intermediates, and then explain why only a single product is formed in this reaction.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_08_EC_050.jpg\" alt=\"A reaction shows  3-methylcyclohexene reacting with hydrogen bromide to form two cis, trans products. 3-Bromocyclohexene reacting with hydrogen bromide to form a dibromocyclohexane.\">",
