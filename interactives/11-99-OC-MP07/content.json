Propose a mechanism, using curved arrows to show the electron flow.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_11_EC_017.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration shows the reaction of a bromohydrin in the presence of NaOH and ethanol to yield epoxide. Bromohydrin shows two carbon atoms single bonded. C1 is single bonded to a hydroxyl group  dash bonded to a hydrogen  and wedge bonded to methyl group. C2 is single bonded to a bromine atom  wedge bonded to a hydrogen  and dash bonded to methyl group. Epoxide shows a 3-membered ring with an oxygen and 2 carbon atoms. Each carbon is dash bonded to a hydrogen and wedge bonded to methyl group.\">",
