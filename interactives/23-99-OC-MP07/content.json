  "taskDescription": "<p>Azlactones are important starting materials used in the synthesis of dehydro <i>&#945;</i>-aminoacids. They react with aldehydes to form an intermediate that is hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to give the final amino acid product. Provide the structure of the intermediate and propose a mechanism for its formation.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_23_EC_020.jpg\" alt=\"The reaction shows azlactone with benzaldehyde in the presence of sodium acetate, yielding an unidentified intermediate. Subsequent reaction with hydronium ion and heat produces dehydro-alpha-amino acid.\">",
