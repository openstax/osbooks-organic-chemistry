  "taskDescription": "<p>A problem often encountered in the oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids is that esters are sometimes produced as by-products. For example, oxidation of ethanol yields acetic acid and ethyl acetate:</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_17_EC_050.jpg\" alt=\"Ethanol reacts with chromium trioxide to form acetic acid and ethylacetate.\">\n<p>Propose a mechanism to account for the formation of ethyl acetate. Take into account the reversible reaction between aldehydes and alcohols:</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_17_EC_051.jpg\" alt=\"An aldehyde, R C H O reacts with R dash O H to form carbon linked to H , R, O H and O R dash group.\">",
