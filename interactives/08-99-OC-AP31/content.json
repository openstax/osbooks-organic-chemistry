  "taskDescription": "<p>Compound <b>A</b>, C<sub>11</sub>H<sub>16</sub>O, was found to be an optically active alcohol. Despite its apparent unsaturation, no hydrogen was absorbed on catalytic reduction over a palladium catalyst. On treatment of <b>A</b> with dilute sulfuric acid, dehydration occurred and an optically inactive alkene <b>B</b>, C<sub>11</sub>H<sub>14</sub>, was the major product. Alkene <b>B</b>, on ozonolysis, gave two products. One product was identified as propanal, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO. Compound <b>C</b>, the other product, was shown to be a ketone, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O. How many degrees of unsaturation does <b>A</b> have? Write the reactions, and identify <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>C</b>.</p>",
