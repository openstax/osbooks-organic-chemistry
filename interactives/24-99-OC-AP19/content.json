  "taskDescription": "<p>Phenacetin, a substance formerly used in over-the-counter headache remedies, has the formula C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>13</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>. Phenacetin is neutral and does not dissolve in either acid or base. When warmed with aqueous NaOH, phenacetin yields an amine, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>11</sub>NO, whose <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum is shown. When heated with HI, the amine is cleaved to an aminophenol, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>7</sub>NO. What is the structure of phenacetin, and what are the structures of the amine and the aminophenol?</p>\n<img src=\"media/OChem_24_EC_040.jpg\" alt=\"Proton spectrum with signals at shift 1.34 (triplet), 3.40 (wide singlet), 3.93 (quartet), and 6.59 and 6.72 (doublets).
