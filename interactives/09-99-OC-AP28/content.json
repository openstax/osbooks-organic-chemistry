  "taskDescription": "<p>Erythrogenic acid, C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>26</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, is an acetylenic fatty acid that turns a vivid red on exposure to light. On catalytic hydrogenation over a palladium catalyst, 5 equivalents of H<sub>2</sub> are absorbed, and stearic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>16</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H, is produced. Ozonolysis of erythrogenic acid gives four products: formaldehyde, CH<sub>2</sub>O; oxalic acid, HO<sub>2</sub>CCO<sub>2</sub>H; azelaic acid, HO<sub>2</sub>C(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>7</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H; and the aldehyde acid OHC(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H. Draw two possible structures for erythrogenic acid, and suggest a way to tell them apart by carrying out some simple reactions.</p>",
