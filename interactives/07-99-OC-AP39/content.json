  "taskDescription": "<p>Reaction of 2,3-dimethyl-1-butene with HBr leads to an alkyl bromide, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>13</sub>Br. On treatment of this alkyl bromide with KOH in methanol, elimination of HBr occurs and a hydrocarbon that is isomeric with the starting alkene is formed. What is the structure of this hydrocarbon, and how do you think it is formed from the alkyl bromide?</p>",
