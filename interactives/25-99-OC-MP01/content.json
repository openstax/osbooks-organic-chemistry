  "taskDescription": "<p>Galactose, one of the eight essential monosaccharides (<b>Section 25.7</b>), is biosynthesized from UDP-glucose by galactose 4-epimerase, where UDP = uridylyl diphosphate (a ribonucleotide diphosphate; <b>Section 28.1</b>). The enzyme requires NAD<sup>+</sup> for activity (<b>Section 17.7</b>), but it is not a stoichiometric reactant, and NADH is not a final reaction product. Propose a mechanism.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_25_EC_006.jpg\" alt=\"U D P galactose is converted by a N A D cation to U D P-galactose.\">",
