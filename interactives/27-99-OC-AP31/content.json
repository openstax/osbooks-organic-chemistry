  "taskDescription": "<p>Cembrene, C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>32</sub>, a diterpenoid hydrocarbon isolated from pine resin, has a UV absorption at 245 nm, but dihydrocembrene (C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>34</sub>), the product of hydrogenation with 1 equivalent of H<sub>2</sub>, has no UV absorption. On exhaustive hydrogenation, 4 equivalents of H<sub>2</sub> react, and octahydrocembrene, C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>40</sub>, is produced. On ozonolysis of cembrene, followed by treatment of the ozonide with zinc, four carbonyl-containing products are obtained:</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_27_EC_020.jpg\" alt=\"The structure of four carbonyl-containing compounds, a dialdehyde, a  keto-aldehyde, a dialdehyde, and a keto-aldehyde. \">\n<p>Propose a structure for cembrene that is consistent with its formation from geranylgeranyl diphosphate.</p>",
