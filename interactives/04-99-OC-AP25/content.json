  "taskDescription": "<p>We saw in Problem 4-20 that <i>cis</i>-decalin is less stable than <i>trans</i>-decalin. Assume that the 1,3-diaxial interactions in <i>cis</i>-decalin are similar to those in axial methylcyclohexane [that is, one CH2&#8596;H interaction costs 3.8 kJ/mol (0.9 kcal/mol)], and calculate the magnitude of the energy difference between <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-decalin.</p>",
