  "taskDescription": "<p>Proteins can be cleaved specifically at the amide bond on the carboxyl side of methionine residues by reaction with cyanogen bromide, BrC<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow>\n  <mtext>≡</mtext>\n</mrow><annotation encoding=\"LaTeX\">\\text{≡}</annotation></semantics></math>N.</p>\n<p><img src=\"media/OChem_26_EC_016.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n<p>The reaction occurs in several steps:</p>\n\n<p><b>(a)</b> The first step is a nucleophilic substitution reaction of the sulfur on the methionine side chain with BrCN to give a cyanosulfonium ion, [R<sub>2</sub>SCN]<sup>+</sup>. Show the structure of the product, and propose a mechanism for the reaction.</p>\n<p><b>(b)</b> The second step is an internal S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, with the carbonyl oxygen of the methionine residue displacing the positively charged sulfur leaving group and forming a five-membered ring product. Show the structure of the product and the mechanism of its formation.</p>\n<p><b>(c)</b> The third step is a hydrolysis reaction to split the peptide chain. The carboxyl group of the former methionine residue is now part of a lactone (cyclic ester) ring. Show the structure of the lactone product and the mechanism of its formation.</p>\n<p><b>(d)</b> The final step is a hydrolysis of the lactone to give the product shown. Show the mechanism of the reaction.</p>",
