  "taskDescription": "<p>One step in the <i>gluconeogenesis</i> pathway for the biosynthesis of glucose is the partial reduction of 3-phosphoglycerate to give glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The process occurs by phosphorylation with ATP to give 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, reaction with a thiol group on the enzyme to give an enzyme-bound thioester, and reduction with NADH. Suggest mechanisms for all three reactions.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_21_EC_035.jpg\" alt=\"The reaction shows the enzyme-catalyzed conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate and an enzyme-bound thioester are formed as intermediates.\">",
