  "taskDescription": "<p>We saw in <b>Section 17.4</b> that ketones react with NaBH<sub>4</sub> to yield alcohols. We&#8217;ll also see in <b>Section 22.3</b> that ketones react with Br<sub>2</sub> to yield <i>&#945;</i>-bromo ketones. Perhaps surprisingly, treatment with NaBH<sub>4</sub> of the <i>&#945;</i>-bromo ketone from acetophenone yields an epoxide rather than a bromo alcohol. Show the structure of the epoxide, and explain its formation.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_18_EC_051.jpg\" alt=\"Acetophenone reacts with bromine to yield alpha-bromo acetophenone; subsequent treatment with sodium borohydride results in an epoxide with unknown structure.\">",
