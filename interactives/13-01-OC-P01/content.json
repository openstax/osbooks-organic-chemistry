  "taskDescription": "<p>The amount of energy required to spin-flip a nucleus depends both on the strength of the external magnetic field and on the nucleus. At a field strength of 4.7 T, rf energy of 200 MHz is required to bring a <sup>1</sup>H nucleus into resonance, but energy of only 187 MHz will bring a <sup>19</sup>F nucleus into resonance. Calculate the amount of energy required to spin-flip a <sup>19</sup>F nucleus. Is this amount greater or less than that required to spin-flip a <sup>1</sup>H nucleus?</p>",
