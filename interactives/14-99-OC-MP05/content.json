  "taskDescription": "<p>A useful diene in the synthesis of many naturally occurring substances is known as Danishefsky&#8217;s diene. It&#8217;s useful because after the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction it can be converted into a product that can't be accessed by a typical Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. Show the Diels&#8211;Alder adduct and propose a mechanism that accounts for the final products.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_14_EC_011.jpg\" alt=\"When heated, Danishefsky&#8217;s Diene reacts with ethene bound to an aldehyde group to yield Diels&#8211;Alder Adduct that reacts with hydrogen chloride to yield three products.\">",
