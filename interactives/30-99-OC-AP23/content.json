  "taskDescription": "<p>When the compound having a cyclobutene fused to a five-membered ring is heated, (1<i>Z</i>,3<i>Z</i>)-1,3-cycloheptadiene is formed. When the related compound having a cyclobutene fused to an eight-membered ring is heated, however, (1<i>E</i>,3<i>Z</i>)-1,3-cyclodecadiene is formed. Explain these results, and suggest a reason why opening of the eight-membered ring occurs at a lower temperature.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_30_EC_027.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclobutene linked to cyclopentane reacts at 270 degree Celsius to form 1,3-cycloheptadiene.
