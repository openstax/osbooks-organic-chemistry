  "taskDescription": "<p>Melamine, used as a fire retardant and a component of the writing surface of white boards, can be prepared from <i>s</i>-trichlorotriazine through a series of S<sub>N</sub>Ar reactions with ammonia. The first substitution takes place rapidly at room temperature. The second substitution takes place near 100 &#176;C, and the third substitution requires even higher temperature and pressure. Provide an explanation for this reactivity.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down-30\" src=\"media/OChem_16_EC_051.jpg\" alt=\"S-Trichlorotriazine reacts with ammonia to yield melamine.
