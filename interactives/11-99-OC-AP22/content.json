  "taskDescription": "<p>Ethers can often be prepared by S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction of alkoxide ions, RO<sup>&#8211;</sup>, with alkyl halides. Suppose you wanted to prepare cyclohexyl methyl ether. Which of the following two possible routes would you choose? Explain.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_11_EC_034.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration shows two reactions that yield cyclohexyl methyl ether as product. In the first reaction  an alkoxide ion reacts with iodomethane. The alkoxide ion shows a cyclo-hexane bonded to an oxygen anion. In the second reaction  iodobenzene reacts with methoxy anion (CH3 O minus). Cyclohexyl methyl ether shows a cyclohexane bonded to a methoxy group.\">",
