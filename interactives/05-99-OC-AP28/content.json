The reaction occurs by addition of &#8202;&#8211;&#8202;OH to the Si face at C3, followed by protonation at C2, also from the Si face. Draw the product of the reaction, showing the stereochemistry of each step.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_05_EC_022.jpg\" alt=\"The figure shows a reaction where crotonate converts to 3-hydroxybutyrate.
