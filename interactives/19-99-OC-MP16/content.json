The mechanism of the process is closely related to the Cannizzaro reaction in that a hydride ion acts as a leaving group. Propose a mechanism.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_19_EC_035.jpg\" alt=\"The reaction shows cyclohexanone with aluminum triisopropoxide, then hydronium ion to yield two products: cyclohexanol and acetone (three-carbon).\">",
