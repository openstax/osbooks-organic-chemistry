  "taskDescription": "<p>Alkynes can be made by dehydrohalogenation of vinylic halides in a reaction that is essentially an E2 process. In studying the stereochemistry of this elimination, it was found that (<i>Z</i>)-2-chloro-2-butenedioic acid reacts 50 times as fast as the corresponding <i>E</i> isomer. What conclusion can you draw about the stereochemistry of eliminations in vinylic halides? How does this result compare with eliminations of alkyl halides?</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_11_EC_039.jpg\" alt=\"A reaction in which (Z)-2-chloro-2-butenedioic acid forms an alkyne in the presence of sodium amide and hydronium ion.\">",
