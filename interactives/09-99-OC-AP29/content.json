  "taskDescription": "<p>Hydrocarbon <b>A</b> has the formula C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>12</sub> and absorbs 3 equivalents of H<sub>2</sub> to yield <b>B</b>, C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>18</sub>, when hydrogenated over a Pd/C catalyst. On treatment of <b>A</b> with aqueous H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in the presence of mercury(II), two isomeric ketones, <b>C</b> and <b>D</b>, are produced. Oxidation of <b>A</b> with KMnO<sub>4</sub> gives a mixture of acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H) and the tricarboxylic acid <b>E</b>. Propose structures for compounds <b>A</b>&#8211;<b>D</b>, and write the reactions.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down-30\" src=\"media/OChem_09_EC_041.jpg\" alt=\"The structure of a C7 tricarboxylic acid labeled E.\">",
