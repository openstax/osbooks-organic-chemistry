  "taskDescription": "<p>The Stork enamine reaction and the intramolecular aldol reaction can be carried out in sequence to allow the synthesis of cyclohexenones. For example, reaction of the pyrrolidine enamine of cyclohexanone with 3-buten-2-one, followed by enamine hydrolysis and base treatment, yields the product indicated. Write each step, and show the mechanism of each.</p>\n<img class=\"scaled-down\" src=\"media/OChem_23_EC_042.jpg\" alt=\"Three-step reaction of 1-cyclohexenylpyrrolidine to produce a bicyclo[4.4.0]decane with C 1 double bond, C 3 oxo.
